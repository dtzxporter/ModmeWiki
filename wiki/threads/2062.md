If one_way is false, zone_a is also made &quot;adjacent&quot; to zone_b<br />// Note that you may not always want zombies coming from zone B while you are in Zone A, but you <br />// might want them to come from B while in A.  It&#39;s a rare case though, such as a one-way traversal.<br /><br />add_adjacent_zone( zone_name_a, zone_name_b, flag_name, one_way, zone_tag_a, zone_tag_b )[/CODE]</p>
