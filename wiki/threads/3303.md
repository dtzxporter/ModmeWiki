<p>I haven&#39;t been making a lot of major progress on any maps up until now and just when things are going great I find that I&#39;m missing textures on my mystery box &#128557;. I&#39;m assuming it must&#39;ve happened at some point while I was in the APE portion of porting xmodels myself or when I downloaded somebody else&#39;s and messed with the GDTs to fix errors. I tried going into APE to try and find a fix but I must&#39;ve deleted the material used for the wooden plank. As for the rope on the side, if it isn&#39;t the same material then I don&#39;t know where it is. Hoping someone knows a fix for this.<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.766.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "Missing Texture.PNG"</a></p>

<p>open model in ape it should show you what textures are missing and use override texture to replace the rope etc <br /><br />for board if its a model you could just replace the model in radiant if its a brush then just apply a texture to it in radiant</p>

I managed to find the missing rope texture through ape and reapply it, as for the board, I found out I could just create a new material in ape, name it after the missing texture and find an image in my files to recreate it and that seemed to do the trick.</p>
