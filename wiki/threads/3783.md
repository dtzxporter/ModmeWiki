<p>Hello all, new to moding and i&#39;m working on building out a map in BO3.<br /><br />I have a sun volume that covers the entire map. Just a basic &quot;day&quot; one as I build and figure things out. Its been working great, but I just did a test built to test a feature, and now my lighting is all screwed up. If I hit the lightning bolt to rebuild, for a brief second it lights everything like it was, and then it goes really dark and I have no idea why. Iv deleted the sun, re added it, rebooted radiant, etc, and still nothing. The only thing I see is at the bottom of the game view, it says &quot;Sun low quality. No sun influencers&quot; but I honestly don&#39;t remember if it was there when it working. Any help would be appreciated. I&#39;ve attached a picture of what it looks like now, and what it looked like previously.<br /><br />Side note, note sure if its related by the buy door I created that was working perfectly has stopped working too. Not sure if they are related, but it seems odd that all this stuff stopped working at once. <br /><br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1233.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "Radiant.PNG"</a><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1234.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "WorkingRadiant.PNG"</a></p>
