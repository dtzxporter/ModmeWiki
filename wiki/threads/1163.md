<p>Thread By: The Black Death<br />In my map I have a script_model with targetname &quot;aldwych_table_urn&quot;. Before a trigger is activated I want it to be playing a looping 3d sound, and after it&#39;ll play another sound (that won&#39;t loop).<br /> <br />To achieve this I&#39;ve tried to use the functions: <br />[CODE=php]// to start the looping audio<br />&lt;entity&gt; PlayLoopSound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)<br /><br />// to end the looping audio<br />&lt;entity&gt; StopLoopSound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)<br /><br />// to play the one-time sound<br />&lt;entity&gt; PlaySound(&lt;aliasname&gt;)&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;&lt;/aliasname&gt;&lt;/entity&gt;[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />(obviously not that code exactly, I have them set up with the script_model and the correct aliases.)<br /> <br />However, when in-game they are not playing the sounds.<br /> <br />Any ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />This should work. Make sure that the alias is 3d, looping and loud enough.<br /> <br />Also add iprintlnbold(); to make sure that the script is actually running</p>

Also add iprintlnbold(); to make sure that the script is actually running  I&#39;ll double check everything :)</blockquote><br /> Okay, checked everything and found that the code is definitely running. Turned up the sounds to 90 volume and checked they were 3d, they still weren&#39;t playing.<br /> <br />these are the aliases I&#39;m trying to use:<br />[CODE=php]# after trigger is used:<br />activate,,,tbd_custom\zm_aldwych\quest_sfx\activate.wav,,,uin_mod,,,,,bus_fx,,,,,,90,90,50,700,701,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,nonlooping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br /><br /># looping sound before trigger is used:<br />amb_electro_magnet_left,,,tbd_custom\zm_aldwych\quest_sfx\amb_electro_magnet_left.wav,,,uin_mod,,,,,bus_fx,,,,,,90,90,50,300,450,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,looping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br />[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />And this is my code:<br />[CODE=php]function mainQuestline() {<br />	iprintlnbold(&quot;function called&quot;);<br />	ritualTableUrn = GetEnt(&quot;aldwych_table_urn&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br />	ritualTableUrn PlayLoopSound(&quot;amb_electro_magnet_left&quot;);<br />	<br />	ritualTableTrigger = GetEnt(&quot;aldwych_table_communicate&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br />	ritualTableTrigger SetHintString(&quot;Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1 ^7to Communicate with the Spirit&quot;);<br />	<br />	ritualTableTrigger waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;, player);<br />	iprintlnbold(&quot;trigger called&quot;);<br />	ritualTableUrn StopLoopSound(&quot;amb_electro_magnet_left&quot;);<br />	ritualTableUrn PlaySound(&quot;activate&quot;);<br />	ritualTableTrigger TriggerEnable(false);<br />	<br />	wait(5);<br />	players = getPlayers();<br />	for(i = 0; i &lt; players.size; i++) {<br />		players<em>PlayLocalSound(&quot;vox_antagonist_quest1&quot;);<br />	}<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br />the PlayLocalSound works fine. it&#39;s just amb_electro_magnet_left and activate.</em></p>

I would spawn a seperate model (like tag_origin) at the models origin then play the loop sound there, the. Delete  the model when you are done</p>

<p>Reply By: ZombieKid164<br />Sounds like it&#39;s something with either your alias or your sound. Make sure your file path is correct, your sound is 48000htz, etc.</p>

I&#39;m starting to think I&#39;ve hit that stupid 2000 alias limit again, so I&#39;ll clean out some unneeded aliases.</p>

I haven&#39;t hit the limit.<br /> <br />The sounds definitely should be fine - they&#39;re directly from zm_genesis and were pumped through Audacity to get them to wav.</p>

<p>Reply By: The Black Death<br />Turns out it didn&#39;t like the idea of playing a sound with the urn. To solve this, I created a script_struct with a targetname I could call in GSC, then spawned a model there, set it to tag_origin and played sounds with that. Thread can be closed now.<br /> <br />Thanks to everyone who helped :)</p>
