<p>Thread By: natesmithzombies<br />How to Add Change Under a Perk Machine<br /><br /><br /><br />Interestingly enough Treyarch didn&#39;t include this already in the Beta even though the code is there. Follow these steps to add the missing pieces to get 100 points by crouching in front of a perk machine:<br /><br /><br /><br />Step 1) Open your mapname.gsc. Example location: A:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\zm_mapname\scripts\zm\zm_mapname.gsc<br /><br /><br /><br />Underneath:<br /><br />[CODE=php]function main()<br />{[/CODE]<br /><br />Add:<br /><br />[CODE=php]level zm_perks::spare_change(); [/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br />Also at the top of your mapname.gsc add:<br /><br />[CODE=php]#using scripts\zm\_zm_perks;<br />#insert scripts\zm\_zm_perks.gsh;[/CODE]<br /><br />Underneath: <br /><br />[CODE=php]#using scripts\zm\_zm_pack_a_punch;[/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Step 2) Press &#39;B&#39; in Radiant to bring up the &quot;Entity Browser&quot;, then drag a Trigger&gt;multiple onto your map. Make it look like so in front of a machine:<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/42104fcfb6870ce2b1bcf2a57ef27b57.png"><br /><br /><br /><br />Step 3) Give the Trigger Multiple the following KVP&#39;s by selecting the trigger and pressing &#39;N&#39; in Radiant:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://gyazo.com/18c781af1fa17084564bc6eee7326df0.png"><br /><br />Step 4) Repeat as many times as necessary, then Link and Compile your map<br /><br />Done!<br /><br />As usual give me a shoutout for using my tutorials ;)</p>

I for sure F***** myself somehow, I get an error with that perk powerup no matter what now. I removed the perk change and still got the issue. I will look into it someother time in the future. Don&#39;t know how this even happened. :(</p></p>

<p>Reply By: SwisherFisher<br /><p style="text-align:left;">well for some reason I get an error for bottomless clip now after I took out the perk bottle for testing. Like what happened to everything???? My map is not going to be updated anymore I guess, there seems to be always an error with these powerups now. I am thinking the issue is that I didn&#39;t update my powerups yet becuase I see they are updated with new things. </p></p>

Saying it isnt working isnt enough for someone to help. I also suggest posting the error to the proper post. If you cant get time warp working post it in that topic </p></p>

<p>Reply By: PaulMcWafflez<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Hey, don&#39;t know if anyone can help, but I get 200pts everytime. Is there any way to get there to be just 100? could it be that being part of the prefab activates it twice? Sorry, Im new to modding.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Azazel<br />could you make it where it randomizes the amount you get? Someone did this in waw, i can find the script if you need it. But it sounds pretty simple. <br /> <br />I just dont have scripting down yet. Ive attempted it twice but nothing. So i just scrapped it.</p>

<p>Does the bump sound no longer work as I hear no audio when bumping into the machine/trigger. It is the same size as shown and the spare change works however no bump sound.</p>

<p>Don’t place a trigger - one is created in the script<br /><br />there will be 2 instances of the change on each machine<br /><br />+200 v +100</p>

<p>Ah much appreciated, Thanks Harry. I also noticed the bump sound is completely missing so I had an attempt at making my own. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come out... great :&#39;D</p>
