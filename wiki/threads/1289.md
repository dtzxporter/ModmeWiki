<p>Thread By: Immens3_Modder<br />I&#39;m making an Easter egg in my map that allows the player to shoot a keypad in the map and if they shoot certain numbers it will unlock a room. I have it working, thee only issue is that there is no way to tell what number to shoot and i was wondering if someone can help. This is the code so far, any improvement would be great.<br />{% highlight php %}
function easter_egg()
{		
	first_number = randomInt(9);
	second_number = randomInt(9);
	third_number = randomInt(9);
	hits = 0;
		
		number1_trig = getent(("number_0" + first_number), "targetname");
		number1_trig waittill("trigger", player);
		
		wait (0.1);
		IPrintLnBold("hit");
		hits++;
		
		number2_trig = getent(("number_0" + second_number), "targetname");
		number2_trig waittill("trigger", player);

		wait (0.1);
		IPrintLnBold("hit");
		hits++;
	
		number3_trig = getent(("number_0" + third_number), "targetname");
		number3_trig waittill("trigger", player);
		
		wait (0.1);
		IPrintLnBold("hit");
		hits++;
	
		if(hits == 3)
		{
			thread unlock_door();
			IPrintLnBold("Unlocked");
		}
}

function unlock_door()
{
	door = getent("weapon_locker_door", "targetname");
	
	wait(0.1);
	
	door Delete();
}{% endhighlight %}
