<p>dont know for a fact but I imagine you could just copy the default user_alias &gt; rename it to whatever you want &gt; then adjust which sound alias is called in your SZC file<br /><br />from there, you would probs just need to switch out what sounds are called for the ones you wanna replace (keeping the same file name, just a different location)<br /><br />E.g You would still name the file &#39;mus_revive_sting.wav&#39; but you would have a custom sound under a different location - the blue is the folder/file path of where to find the audio file<br /><br /># QUICK REVIVE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br />mus_perks_revive_sting,,,[COLOR=rgb(41, 105, 176)]zombie\perks\mus[/COLOR]\mus_revive_sting.wav,,,UIN_MOD,,,,,BUS_FX,,,,,,60,60,50,550,551,,,,,3,oldest,,,1,1,,,,,,3d,wpn_all,,NONLOOPING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br /><br /><br /><br />Hopefully this helps in some way - anyonre mroe experienced, feel free to correct any mistakes i made if need be</p>
