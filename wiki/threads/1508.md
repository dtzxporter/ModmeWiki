<p>Thread By: Dick_Nixon<br /><p style="text-align:left;">I&#39;ve ported over the Stick Grenades from the BO1 WaW maps, put them into a grenadeweapon, and got them successfully into game, as in they work exactly as i want them to. The only problem i am experiencing with them is when i give them through console at the begining of the game, it puts them into the tactical grenade slot, rendering them useless, and when i buy them from a wallbuy, they take away the weapon the player is holding, as well as going to the tactical grenade slot, rendering them useless. the only way i can get them to work is if i do /take all and give them to myself through, which seems to be the only way i can get them into my lethal grenade slot successfully. i&#39;ve gone into APE and put it specifically to lethal grenade in as many options as i could, and it still without fault, keeps giving me these problems. is there any practical solution to this? or is this a scripting kind of problem?(i havent scripted anything to these grenades). Any help would be extremely appreciated.</p></p>

I think that can be fixed the same way as the Lil&#39;Arnies fix.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Correct me if i&#39;m wrong, this is going to be a wild guess.:</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">In zm_usermap.gsc, there&#39;s a function called &quot;offhand_weapon_overrride()&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I think you have to add your lethal grenade in there.</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Let&#39;s say you called the stick grenade &quot;Sticky&quot;:</p>{% highlight php %}
zm_utility::register_lethal_grenade_for_level( "Sticky" );
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}
level.zombie_lethal_grenade_player_init = GetWeapon( "Sticky" );
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Like i said, this is a wild guess because i don&#39;t really know alot of scripting for bo3, so if anyone can correct me if i&#39;m wrong, would be awesome. :)</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Dick_Nixon<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Thanks dude! both of those worked. the &quot; zm_utility::register_lethal_grenade_for_level( &quot;ger_grenate&quot; );&quot; command eliminated both the losing weapon problem and the putting-it-as-a-tactical problem i&#39;ve been having. all i had to do was put them under function_main() and it worked like a charm!</p></p>
