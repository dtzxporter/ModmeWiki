<p>When it&#39;s taking your weapons and your cash, do you also hear Samantha laugh? If so, the script gives you a third weapons without Mule Kick or a fourth weapons with Mule Kick. I&#39;m guessing this is an issue with GiveWeapon. When you want to give a weapon, use <br />{% highlight php %}
player zm_weapons::weapon_give(getweapon( WEAPON_NAME_HERE ));{% endhighlight %}
And make sure to add<br />{% highlight php %}
#using scripts\zm\_zm_weapons;{% endhighlight %}
to the top of any files that use your functions.</p>

<p>Also, I am confused with a few parts of your code that might cause issues.<br />{% highlight php %}
player = GetPlayers();
current = player GetWeaponsListPrimaries();

...

player TakeWeapon(current);
{% endhighlight %}
GetPlayers returns an array of all players in the game, then you treat that array like an individual player to get their list of primaries, then you use TakeWeapon to remove all weapons they have, not just the current one they&#39;re holding. I&#39;m guessing a lot of that isn&#39;t intentional. If you explain what the script is supposed to do, I can help fix it.</p>

As in the first replay that is that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening. The player gets the weapon but immediately afterwards Samantha laughs and then the weapons and money are zeroed.<br />The meaning of the script is <br /><br />{% highlight php %}
function Award()
{
player = GetPlayers();
current = player GetWeaponsListPrimaries();
weapon = getWeapon("microwavegundw");
here = GetEnt("here", "targetname");
loot_t = GetEnt("loot_t", "targetname");
loot_t SetHintString("Press &amp;&amp;1 to turn on");
loot_t SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
loot_t waittill("trigger", player);
loot_t Delete();
wait 1;
player PlaySoundWithNotify("award01", "soundcomplete");
player waittill("soundcomplete");
wait 15;
player PlaySoundWithNotify("award02", "soundcomplete");
player waittill("soundcomplete");
wait 10;
player PlaySoundWithNotify("award03", "soundcomplete");
player waittill("soundcomplete");
//At this point GIVE WEAPON TO PLAYER
player TakeWeapon(current);
wait 1;
player GiveWeapon(weapon);
player SwitchToWeapon(weapon);
wait 3;
thread zm_powerups::specific_powerup_drop("full_ammo", here.origin);
iPrintLn("complete");
}{% endhighlight %}
<br />i first try to display the weapon like a wallbuy that the player only could see when the script was done. <br />so to compile it all i would like the weapon to &quot;spawn&quot; so the player could chose to grab it or not. <br />or leave it for a team mate. <br />like the easter eggs in when a weapon amerges from anywhere.<br /><br />That wolud be amazing :D<br />and thank you for replaying <br /><br />&quot;Sorry for bad English&quot;</p>
