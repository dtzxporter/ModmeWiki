<p>Thread By: Azsry<br />[UNOFFICIAL] T7 Animation Rig<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing as Treyarch did not provide any animating assets with the mod tools, I decided to make this a while back. It is essentially the same animation rig setup from World at War, but configured to work with BO3 viewhands. While this is not useful for many people at the time of writing/releasing this rig, it will give everyone ample time to get some animation sets ready for the public release of the mod tools. (There are A LOT of extra animations to create in BO3).</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/QyFF4gT.png"><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>USAGE:</strong><br /><br />Usage is <em>nearly</em> identical to the official animation rig that shipped with World at War/Black Ops 1. This release assumes that you already know how to use the official animation rig provided by Treyarch/IW. If you do not know how to use those, use them first as this one is inherently going to have some issues upon initial release that I will eventually get around to fixing.<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;ol&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Import your bound gun into the rig scene.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Make the root bone of your gun (e.g. j_gun or tag_weapon) a child bone of tag_weapon_right.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Move the root bone of your gun to the middle of Gun_CTR.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Use the round hand controllers to position the hands on the gun and animate as usual.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>DIFFERENCES TO OFFICIAL RIG:</strong><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">As the BO3 viewhands configuration is rather different from the legacy layout, some compromises had to be made to keep everything operational.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;">&lt;ol&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;j_wristtwist_le/ri on the old rig would have the same X rotation as j_wrist_le/ri, but there are now 7 wristtwist joints, so each of them is aligned to j_wrist_le/ri&#39;s rotation by a different influence decreasing from 1 to 0.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Box controllers on the hands do not move with the circle controllers. These are not linked to the Gun_CTR and operate in conjunction with IK Gun Switch so you can control the hands separate from the gun rig for reloads and putaway/pullouts.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;There are now two cameras under tag_camera. They are designed to match 65 and 90 FOV in game with one viewport and with the Channel Box editor on the right.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Two new sets have been added called FK_LE and FK_RI respectively. These act as a quick access to all the finger controls so users can key all finger rotations quickly.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br /></p><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:</strong><br /><br />&lt;ol&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Finger curls are not yet implemented due to issues with blending the driven keyed rotations with user-applied rotations.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;Rotation axes are not locked for the finger joints. They will still work properly if rotated on the Z axis in Object mode, but will act strangely when rotating using World coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>CHANGELOG:</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}

<p>Reply By: elfenliedtopfan5<br />This is incredible rig really is only issue i have is the fingers but acer did show me a way to fix that :) so all is good :) <br /><br /><br /><br />i dont know if Acer did this or not but you have a link with a description key combinded here it is <br /><br /><br /><br />//Link removed<br /><br /><br /><br />if you want people to add the key manually i will remove this link <br /><br /><br /><br />but this is amazing work and i cant wait to start porting custom models to bo3 and custom animations great work :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Ray1235<br />Why does everyone parents the IK_Global_Hand_LE_CTR to Hand_Gun_CTR_LE (same thing for RI), it&#39;s an incorrect way to make the hands move with the gun and it&#39;s unbelievably pissing me off.<br /><br />EDIT: Nvm, apparently you made their position the same as IK_Global_Hand_* which made it seem like they&#39;re parented to each other.</p>
