<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />Basically I&#39;m making a boss who uses a flamethrower on you. I have most of it figured out but I&#39;m having some problems with the damage of the flames because the boss deals damage in a radius instead of one direction.<br /> <br />This is what I have so far:<br />[CODE=php]foreach( player in players )<br />{<br />	if( Distance2d(player.origin, self.origin) &lt; 300 &amp;&amp; self.boss_enemy == player )<br />	{<br />	player DoDamage( 40, player.origin, self ); <br />	}<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />As you can see in this script, the fire will kill anyone withing a 300 unit radius but I need it to kill within 30 degrees of the front of the boss.<br />See image below.<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://i.imgur.com/jSZWpjc.png"><br />sorry for bad artwork<br /> <br />PS does anyone know how to give the player the flames HUD effect like when the panzer sets you on fire?<br />PS2 does anyone have a cool flamethrower effect?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />I have been gone a while and haven&#39;t had the chance to answer some questions. Here is a copy and paste of the function I use to see if a boss is facing its target: <br />[CODE=php]function is_facing( facee )<br />{<br />	orientation = self getPlayerAngles();<br />	forwardVec = anglesToForward( orientation );<br />	forwardVec2D = ( forwardVec[0], forwardVec[1], 0 );<br />	unitForwardVec2D = VectorNormalize( forwardVec2D );<br />	toFaceeVec = facee.origin+(0,0,62) - self.origin;<br />	toFaceeVec2D = ( toFaceeVec[0], toFaceeVec[1], 0 );<br />	unitToFaceeVec2D = VectorNormalize( toFaceeVec2D );<br />	<br />	dotProduct = VectorDot( unitForwardVec2D, unitToFaceeVec2D );<br />	return ( dotProduct &gt; 0.95 ); <br />}[/CODE]</p>
