<p>Thread By: apechound<br />Recently, I&#39;ve been trying to export a model I downloaded that was made in Blender to use in a map, and when I&#39;ve exported it as an xmodel then gone to convert it through Kronos, it says that it failed conversion.<br />When I try using the original export2bin.exe method, it gives me an error message saying:<br />&quot;ERROR: UINT16: Out of range value for NUMVERTS in file&quot;<br /> <br />Any ideas how I could get round this?</p>

Do you have an armature in the scene?</p>
