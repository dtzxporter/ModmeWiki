<p><blockquote>sorry for this where zm_buried_ghost :: spawn_witch (health) would be attached;<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />This is just a line you can add to a script function so if a trigger is activated or a door is opened it&#39;ll spawn a witch with the health argument.</p>

<p>Do you think you can send me the document where you have your script?</p>

<p>So I have (as per the tutorial) [ICODE]#using scripts\zm\zm_buried_ghost;[/ICODE] inside my mapname.gsc like so: <br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.339.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />Then I have (again, as per the tutorial) the sound aliases in my mapname.szc like so:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.341.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />To access your mapname.GSC you can open mod tools, right click your map name and select open map folder, then go to: scripts/zm/&quot;zm_mapname.gsc&quot;<br />To access your mapname.SZC you can open your map folder as explained above, go to: sound/zoneconfig/&quot;zm_mapname.szc&quot;</p>

<p>thanks but I meant the script of the trigger to spawn a witch</p>

---
<strong style="font-size: 1.4em;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: #34a7f9;"><span style="color:#34a7f9;">ChiefMustardo</span></span>:</strong>

<p>You don&#39;t actually need this code to have them spawn in: [ICODE]zm_buried_ghost::spawn_witch(health);[/ICODE]<br /><br />However, you could do something like this:<br /><br />[CODE=php]function witch()<br />{<br />    trigger = GetEnt(&quot;witchTrigger&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;); // You would name a trigger witchTrigger (whether it is a use, multi or whatever)<br />    trigger waittil(&quot;trigger&quot;, player); // This waits for the trigger to be activated by a player<br />    zm_buried_ghost::spawn_witch(health); // Then it will spawn a witch at a struct provided<br /><br />}<br /><br />// Make sure to &quot;thread witch();&quot; in your &quot;function main()&quot;[/CODE]<br /><br />This is a basic mock up and should work unless I fucked up somewhere. Just to serve as an example.</p>

And it doesnt have a script_noteworthy kvp</p>

<p>Ofc I compiled, ether would the IPrintLnBold activate ?<br />The struct is placed beside the starting spawns in start-zone.<br />When I didn&#39;t have a script_noteworthy, it was 2 IPrintLnBold that also said &quot;No script noteworthy&quot;.<br />So yes, the script_noteworthy is &quot;witch_spawner&quot; and the Targetname is &quot;witch_spot&quot;.<br /><br />But I hope I made this work, it sais from you that this I made would work :) So thx anyway, I&#39;will continue my work on my last map :P</p>

<p><blockquote>The struct needs to be On or abov the Floor. Not in like the ordinary spawns. Test it up ;)<br /></blockquote><br />Ordinary spawns should also have the origin on or above the ground mate...<br /><br />that wouldn’t stop them spawning anyway they would just spawn and be stuck</p>

<p>Coz the origin needs to be inside the “zone” has nothing to do with the floor</p>

<p>This is just down to not setting it up properly<br /><br />zombie spawns do not need to be in zones, he obv groups them by checking what sone they touch</p>

<p><blockquote>I know, I said I had wrong, thought wrong. But the zombie spawns can be inside the floor that is on my map Half inside the zone, so I thought it was because the floor, if you understand my thinking. But the Brutus structs and Ghost struct needed to be 100% inside the zone, not like the other zombie spawns and dog spawns.<br /></blockquote><br />Zombies don’t need to be in a zone at all</p>

<p><blockquote>That struct was between the zone and outside. After I moved it up a little, they start to spawn. How many time you say it isn&#39;t the struct. Even Spiki told me here in this, that the error can cause if it isn&#39;t inside an active zone...<br /></blockquote><br />I said ZOMBIE spawns do not need to be in a zone at all<br /><br />look at nacht<br /><br />learn to read, ive not a single time said this isn’t correct for the ghosts I said it prob is due to the code being different because the AUTHOR obv did a check for which zone the struct is in</p>

<p><blockquote>oh i did didnt i XD<br /></blockquote><br />Let me know if you get them to spawn because I&#39;ve done something wrong. Idk if it&#39;s the KVP&#39;s or what it could be at this point. I can make them spawn in like normal zombies but not like witches are supposed to spawn. Good luck! Also, thank you spiki for releasing these. It was the main thing I needed for my map.</p>

<p><blockquote>aww kinda wished that they do haha, thanks for the response!<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I think they did that in 1 spot of the house in Buried, but if you remember zombies could not access the house. <br /><br />What you would need to do for that I believe is make a segment of a wall that was non-colliding, and then cover over that segment with a player clip to block players from being able to walk through it. Then somewhere on the other side of that segment of wall, out of sight of the players put the witch/ghost spawn point and I imagine it wouldn&#39;t be too incredibly hard to script a trigger that will spawn one when the player walks into it. I think that&#39;s sort of what they did in buried. <br /><br />If you just made a whole bunch of non-colliding walls though, your zombies would just run through them to reach the players and it would look like absolute shit.</p>

<p>Anybody that can get these witches to spawn the correct way and has detailed instructions/tutorial let me know, because up to this point I&#39;ve worked on them for a month straight and everything that has been mentioned in this forum hasn&#39;t worked. This is holding my map up, so I think I&#39;m going to delete them and just go with a different theme.</p>

Now I&#39;m going to try and figure out this logic. I bet its easy but I&#39;m overlooking things. Thank You</p>

<p><blockquote>how wood I go about having them spawn in a specific zone like in Buried.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />With a struct in the zone you want them to spawn, activated by a trigger when a player enters that zone, or when the zone becomes active from a script flag on a debris. <br />A spawner, a trigger and struct in any case.</p>
