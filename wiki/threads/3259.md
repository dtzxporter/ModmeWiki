<p>To make things simpler, I want to be able to have maybe 3 to 5 different ways a script can go each game. Completely random on which one takes place so that every time someone plays, it&#39;s not exactly the same. How can I do this? I only have pretty basic knowledge of scripting. Any and all help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but I wonder if you could reverse engineer something like the shi no numa perk script.</p>

<p>GSC has several built in random number functions. You can use RandomInt for a whole number less than a certain value (so RandomInt(5) would be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). RandomIntRange lets you choose a different starting point than zero, like if you wanted the numbers from 10 to 20 for example. RandomFloat and RandomFloatRange create decimal &quot;floating point&quot; numbers like 1.3, 5.7, etc. in the same way.<br /><br />What you want in your case is:<br />{% highlight php %}
switch(RandomInt(5))
{
    case 0:
        //SCRIPT SCENARIO 0
        break;
    case 1:
        //SCRIPT SCENARIO 1
        break;
    case 2:
        //SCRIPT SCENARIO 2
        break;
    case 3:
        //SCRIPT SCENARIO 3
        break;
    case 4:
        //SCRIPT SCENARIO 4
        break;
}{% endhighlight %}
</p>
