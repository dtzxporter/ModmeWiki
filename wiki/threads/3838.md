# New weapons have weird animations and are floating

I imported a lot of custom weapons. And they all work. I added Cold War weapons from pmr360 and they work.  Then I saw he updated those weapons and I deleted my old ones and put in the new ones. They basically float and don&#39;t work and their animations are janky and move in slow mo. Then I tried other custom weapons and they don&#39;t work either. Any new custom weapons I put in my map don&#39;t work, they just float. No error, no anything. I thought it was the weapon limit soo I removed my old weapons and the problem still persists. Did I fuck up my files somehow? If I did shouldn&#39;t there be an error. But there are no errors. I also tried deleting everything cold war related, and it doesn&#39;t matter, new weapons of any sort don&#39;t work. (if I verify game cache will that destroy my maps?)

Fixed. All I had to do was change my windows regional settings to English. Date and time and language. Now it works.

You also have to redownload the weapons if it happens to you.
