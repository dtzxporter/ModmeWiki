Because the first person view in bo4 is kinda different to the one in bo3 so maybe move it a little forward, because if you&#39;re playing on fov of a console player (somewhere around 88) you can&#39;t really see the bottle. that&#39;s why you may need to look at it again and maybe try to change some of the things.<br />But I love the work and keep on porting!</p>

<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br />Right now you&#39;re working on fixing the fov for the perk bottle of the bo4 version, but are you also planning on releasing a version with the anims of the chaos crew (the new perk statue&#39;s). It would probably be a little more complex, but would be cool to see even though in bo4 you have and don&#39;t have perks that are inside of bo3.<br /> <br />I&#39;m asking this because currently I&#39;m working on a map that&#39;s set in a dungeon. So like these statue&#39;s could work pretty well. But like I said, it&#39;s gonna be a bit more complex I think.<br /> <br />Well that&#39;s all, keep up the porting and the hard work you put into these things!<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/tongue.png"></p>
