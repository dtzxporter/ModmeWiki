<p>I want to fix something but I am not a script-er. When I added sound in the user_aliases for some of the community assets I noticed that<strong>sound plays when the game is paused. </strong>I know there is a way to fix it but I don&#39;t know where to start. The only place I think might fix it is the SZC file in my map files. I noticed that the scripts I added in with a SZC stops when paused. <br /><br />This can be annoying because when I test, I like to pause then work on things that need to be changed and I hear sounds in the background.</p>

<p>in your [COLOR=rgb(65, 168, 95)]sound alias [/COLOR]you need to make the [COLOR=rgb(243, 121, 52)]Pauseable variable [/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(84, 172, 210)]true[/COLOR]</p>

I had no idea that there was a reference in the file like the levelcommon_weapons file. Thank you!</p>
