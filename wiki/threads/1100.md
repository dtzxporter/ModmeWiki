<p>Thread By: ZombieKid164<br />Does anyone know how to make multiple box starting locations? I know this has been possible from very early on in the BO3 Mod tools lifetime because Madgaz&#39;s map &quot;Fabrik Der Untoten&quot; had it. I&#39;m just not quite sure how you would go along doing this. Thanks!</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />add this to your mapname.gsc to randomize start box spawn<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
level.random_pandora_box_start = 1;{% endhighlight %}
 <br />add this as a kvp to the box prefab to exclude it (in case you don&#39;t want the box in the spawn room to spawn first)<br /> <br />start_exclude = 1<br /> <br /> <br />&lt;hr&gt;Source: _zm_magicbox.gsc line 200</p>
