<p>Thread By: Frost Iceforge<br />Customizable bank system for BO3 Zombies maps inspired by the bank from Zombies in Spaceland. <br /> <br />This adds a pool of money shared among all players accessible using 2 trigger_use brushes with targetnames &quot;iw_bank_deposit&quot; and &quot;iw_bank_withdrawal.&quot;<br /> <br />I added option to require a fee to withdraw from the bank like in Black Ops II. Fee, initial balance, and interval of deposit/withdrawal all editable.<br /> <br />INSTRUCTIONS: <br />1. If you don&#39;t have any other scripts to give or take points in your map&#39;s GSC, add this to the top of zm_MAPNAME.gsc with the other #using things<br />{% highlight php %}
#using scripts\zm\_zm_score;{% endhighlight %}
2. Add the following to your function main() in zm_MAPNAME.gsc<br />{% highlight php %}
//Frosty&#39;s IW style bank system
level thread iw_bank_system_init();{% endhighlight %}
3. Add the following BELOW your function_main() in zm_MAPNAME.gsc<br />{% highlight php %}
//Frosty&#39;s IW style bank system
function iw_bank_system_init()
{
	//START OF EDITABLE VARIABLES
	level.payments_in_bank = 0; //Change to have bank start with money. Amount is this times interval.
	level.payment_interval = 1000; //Change to have bank deposit or withdrawal in different intervals. IW and BO2 used 1000.
	level.withdrawal_fee = 0; //Fee for each withdrawal. Set to 100 for BO2 style, and 0 for IW style.
	//END OF EDITABLE VARIABLES
	deposit = GetEnt( "iw_bank_deposit", "targetname" );
	withdrawal = GetEnt( "iw_bank_withdrawal", "targetname" );
	deposit SetCursorHint( "HINT_NOICON" );
	deposit SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to deposit $" + level.payment_interval + " [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");
	withdrawal SetCursorHint( "HINT_NOICON" );
	if(level.withdrawal_fee &gt; 0)
	{
		withdrawal SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to withdraw $" + level.payment_interval + " [Fee: $" + level.withdrawal_fee + "] [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");
	}
	else
	{
		withdrawal SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to withdraw $" + level.payment_interval + " [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");
	}
	deposit thread iw_bank_deposit_logic(withdrawal);
	withdrawal thread iw_bank_withdrawal_logic(deposit);
}

function iw_bank_deposit_logic(withdrawal)
{
	while(1)
	{
		self waittill("trigger", player);
		if(player.score &gt;= level.payment_interval)
		{
			level.payments_in_bank++;

			player zm_score::minus_to_player_score(level.payment_interval);

			self SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to deposit $" + level.payment_interval + " [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");

			if(level.withdrawal_fee &gt; 0)
			{
				withdrawal SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to withdraw $" + level.payment_interval + " [Fee: $" + level.withdrawal_fee + "] [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");
			}
			else
			{
				withdrawal SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to withdraw $" + level.payment_interval + " [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");
			}
		}
	}
}

function iw_bank_withdrawal_logic(deposit)
{
	while(1)
	{
		self waittill("trigger", player);
		if(level.payments_in_bank &gt;= 1)
		{
			level.payments_in_bank--;

			player zm_score::add_to_player_score(level.payment_interval);

			deposit SetHintString("Hold ^3[{+activate}]^7 to deposit $" + level.payment_interval + " [Balance: $" + (level.payments_in_bank * level.payment_interval) + "]");

4. Add 2 trigger_use brushes with targetnames &quot;iw_bank_deposit&quot; and &quot;iw_bank_withdrawal&quot; to your Radiant map file.<br />5. Save everything. Compile and link and you&#39;re done!<br /> <br />Be sure to credit me in your published map.<br /> <br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJjYlA6b06o" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

If not, add this with the #using stuff at the top:<br />{% highlight php %}
#using scripts\zm\_zm_score;{% endhighlight %}

<p>Reply By: Frost Iceforge<br />I am adding the requirement to add #using scripts\zm\_zm_score to the top of your GSC. I forgot this was not normally there since I add it to all my own maps. This should fix the compile error.</p>

The only thing I can think of is to triple check that your triggers are named the right KVPs, or that your triggers are in fact trigger use. Make sure they have targetnames &quot;iw_bank_deposit&quot; and &quot;iw_bank_withdrawal.&quot; <br />PM me screenshots showing everything is spelled and set up correctly and still doesn&#39;t work, and I&#39;ll PM you my Discord and we can call about it.</p>

I&#39;d have to check every script tutorial ever made. <br /> <br />I have considered making a BO2 style bank, but I have NO IDEA how to make variables carry over across games. The only one I have ever seen was Project Thor on World at War customs having the BO2 fridge. Never seen it in BO3. The second I find out how to make it, I will make it an option here and make a BO2 style fridge.<br /><br /><br />For now, I&#39;m considering making a Revelations style weapon table, so look forward to that! <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/wink.png"></p>
