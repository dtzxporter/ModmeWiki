<p>With &quot;NotSolid()&quot;, players cant cross others players, and i die instantly by one hit, after many attempts of hits of the zombies, very weird.</p>

<p>You have to disable the thing that kills you<br /><br />That happens anyway if you jump “on” another player<br /><br />It’s a function and has been there since bo1<br /><br />As for zombies killing you weird I have no idea</p>
