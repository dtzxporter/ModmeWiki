<p>Thread By: mathfag<br />How do I clip a model that is spawned via script and then animated (and deleted when it&#39;s done)? I can&#39;t use a standard collision map because different parts of the model are moving and I need the clip to move with them.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />cant spawn script brushmodels and theres no need to animate a clip, you should clip the entire object blocking players from getting anywhere near any moving parts. Anything else would be either not possible or problematic ( notice treyarch do not do this at any point )</p>
