<p>Reply By: JellyAlex<br />Duplicate the non pap weapon file and name the new file weaponname_upgraded_zm. Change the stats inside the weapon (damage, timers, hip spread, etc) to make it a better weapon. I am unsure of how to add a pap camo with camotables as I have not been able to get it to work, the only way I know (only temporary fix not reccomended) is to duplicate the xmodels and add a material override of your pap camo material. Once done everything in APE, open up your map&#39;s zone file and add weapon,weaponname_upgraded_zm. Next navigate to zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv (share\raw\gamedata\weapons\zm) and add the pap weapon name after the first comma WITHOUT _zm, eg:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
m14,m14_upgraded,,750,rifle,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,rifle,,,{% endhighlight %}
<br />You can create sound aliases with the pap weapon sound.<br /><br /><br /><br />Correct me if i missed anything</p>
