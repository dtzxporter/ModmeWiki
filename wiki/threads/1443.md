<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />I have used this in the past so if it doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s on you<br />[CODE=php]function sound_on_power()<br />{<br />level waittill(&quot;power_on&quot;);<br /><br />foreach(player in GetPlayers())<br />	{<br /><br /> 		player PlayLocalSound(&quot;power_on_mus&quot;);<br /> 		IPrintLnBold(&quot;sound&quot;);<br /><br />	}<br />}	[/CODE]</p>

And it wasn’t working because nobody was called to play the function ^^</p>

<p>Reply By: TheJaguarPlays<br /><blockquote><em>kingkenny</em><br />QuentinN33 self Playsound(&quot;aliases&quot;);  thank you for your reply. that didn&#39;t work. i tried self playsound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;) and self playlocalsound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;) but there is still no sound when turning on the power.i also tried a non-custom soundalias to make sure that it&#39;s not my file that doesn&#39;t work but no, even then i had no sound.this is my current function init_power() function init_power() { level flag::wait_till(&quot;power_on&quot;); level util::set_lighting_state(2); self PlaySound( &quot;mus_gameover_intro&quot; ); // thread zm_utility::really_play_2D_sound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;); }</blockquote><br /> Okay just making sure at 1 thing, are you also 100% sure your sound was actually added in your csv and also that it linked in your launcher like when you compile your map? that could also be the problem xd</p>

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />One more thing, <br /><br />I would like to take this thing a step further. <br />Is it possible to have a script that when a player joins the lobby (through server browser) after the game has already started will check if the power is on and if yes it will play a sound but only for the player that joined?<br /><br />btw where do you guys find all these script functions?<br />is there a list or did you have to find everything out by yourself?<br /><br />Thank you for any answer!</p>

You can remove all of  function sound_on_power()   update: function power_func() //self = player { if(level flag::exists(&quot;power_on&quot;) &amp;&amp; level flag::get(&quot;power_on&quot;)) { self PlayLocalSound(&quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot;); } level waittill(&quot;power_on&quot;); self PlayLocalSound(&quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot;); }</blockquote><br /> <br /> i tried this out now but it seems like there is now no sound at all when turning on the power. (yes i did thread the new function)<br /><br />But i don&#39;t think &quot;self playLocalSound&quot; works at all because that was the first thing i tried when i wanted to play music when turning on the power, but when i simply added &quot;self playLocalSound&quot; to the init_power function earlier it didn&#39;t work.<br /><br />any ideas?</p>

<p>Reply By: xdferpc<br />try with this: <br />[CODE=php]function power_func() //self = player<br />{<br />level.playSoundLocation PlaySound(&quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot;);<br />if(level flag::exists(&quot;power_on&quot;) &amp;&amp; level flag::get(&quot;power_on&quot;))<br />	{<br />	self PlayLocalSound(&quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot;);<br />	}<br /><br />level waittill(&quot;power_on&quot;);<br />self PlayLocalSound(&quot;kino_teleport_2d&quot;);<br />}[/CODE]</p>

<p>Reply By: kingkenny<br />i think the problem lies within the line:<br /><br /><br />[CODE=php]if(level flag::exists(&quot;power_on&quot;) &amp;&amp; level flag::get(&quot;power_on&quot;))[/CODE]<br /> <br />i tried out the following<br />[CODE=php]function power_func() //self = player<br />{<br />if(level flag::exists(&quot;power_on&quot;) &amp;&amp; level flag::get(&quot;power_on&quot;))<br />	{<br /> 	IPrintLnBold(&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;);<br />	self PlayLocalSound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;);<br />	}<br /><br />level waittill(&quot;power_on&quot;);<br />self PlayLocalSound(&quot;MY_SOUND_ALIAS&quot;);<br />}[/CODE]<br />but neither me nor my friend had the IPrintLnBold-text on the screen.</p>
