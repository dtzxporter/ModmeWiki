<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />though you could technically spawn them in after an event occurs, I personally would use Hide() and Show() instead. Basically shortly after the game starts you can hide your trigs and objects with:<br />{% highlight php %}
object Hide();{% endhighlight %}
 <br />This means they won&#39;t be visible and can be walked right through. Then when you want to use them again you can use:<br />{% highlight php %}
object Show();{% endhighlight %}
 <br />These items will simply appear out of thin air to players, so if players will be seeing it it might be a good idea to play an FX and/or sound or something to make it look nicer presentation-wise.</p>
