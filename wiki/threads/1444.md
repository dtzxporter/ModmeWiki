I went looking for a solution but couldn&#39;t really find anything. I knew It&#39;d be something real simple like this though...<br /> <br />I just added these lines in to the zone file;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffff00;">scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/_zm_soul_chests.gsc</span><br /><span style="color:#ffff00;">scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/_zm_harrybo21_utility.gsc</span><br /> <br />SMH</p>
