<p>Thread By: TCM<br />I want to spawn a script model through the GSC hard coded, So basically when they pick up a perk I want the model to spawn in and I am going to have the animation play on it and them walk and when shot drop the actual perk, Just messing with ideas but not entirely sure how to set the animation on a script model that is hard coded.<br /> <br />Nevermind for anyone that needs help on this as well should be done this way<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
TestModel = Spawn("script_model", (-447, -548, 0));
    TestModel SetModel("MODELNAME");{% endhighlight %}

I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m defending this poor kid you&#39;ve basically been harassing on Modme for the last month. I wasn&#39;t gonna do it originally but you just kept on making fun of him, and I thought enough was enough.<br /> <br />Don&#39;t throw that bullshit &quot;it was just an observation&quot;. Your comments are so caustically worded and condescending to just be an &quot;observation&quot;. <br /> <br />Also this: &quot;I dont care even remotely about your opinion&quot;. C&#39;mon, if you replied to this post, it means you care, even if it is just slightly.<br /> <br />Bottom Line: These forums are for <strong>helping people.</strong> What you are doing is <strong>not</strong> helping people, and causing nothing but toxicity. It&#39;s in the frigging Modme rules for cryin&#39; out loud:<br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://imgur.com/2IGb13U.png"><br /> <br />Criticism should be <strong>constructive</strong> and based on <strong>a modder&#39;s work</strong>, but what you said was neither.<br /> <br />I&#39;m no SJW, I understand that tough love can be important sometimes, but this is just not the place for it. I don&#39;t think TCM is going to want to become any better of a modder just because you keep insulting his intelligence and acting like you can&#39;t believe basic scripting things are &quot;beyond him&quot;. If anything it&#39;s highly discouraging, and would most likely make people want to stop modding, not try to improve themselves.<br /> <br />I know you hate it more than anything for someone else to tell you what to do or say that what you did is wrong, I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what you mean when you say I&#39;m on my &quot;high horse&quot;. I&#39;m sorry if this comes off like I&#39;m acting like a parent scolding a child, but I just felt like I had to say something, cause you keep doing this shit. Just let it go, Harry.<br /> <br />You are an inspiration to me, but I just wish you&#39;d play nicer with others.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />He’s the one who said he is “well versed” in gsc so yes the fact he’s caught out by a simple function and I pointed the inconsistency out is a “observation”. I merely showed my confusion to a “experienced scripter” not being able to use simple functions that are fully documented in the api and have literally always existed. And “helped” by pointing out that’s not what “hard coded” means. Sorry you don’t like that I voiced how this confused me, I feel for you. I’ll light a candle<br /> <br />twice ive posted so don’t bullshit this “all month” crap. You even said right before “I don’t know about the other posts”<br /> <br />i broke no rule i didnt insult him at all<br /> <br />yes you are a sjw - that’s why your leaping to the “poor guy”s defence despite it being<br /> <br />a - none of your business <br />b - his own fault because I tried to help him and infact did on like 10 different topics and he responded by insulting ME co he didn’t like the literal answers<br /> <br />get real abnormal. You keep sticking your nose in anything I do just like you claim I’m doing to him. If your concerned contact the staff otherwise I don’t give a shit about your need to pretend to be the defender of the people<br /> <br />sjw - just like when you reuploaded MY work coz you decided me keeping it to myself was unfair. If you can’t handle the modding community - stay out of it<br /> <br />stop pretending you are the embodiment of goodness and what everyone else should be and stop commenting on my “tough love” coz frankly I find that as insulting as you claim I’m being to him<br /> <br />i have the wins and ugx respect that I do because of how much I help and I don’t give two shits if you don’t “approve” of “how” I do it<br /> <br />also forums are for “discussion” - there is no rule that you may only speak if you are providing an answer. Check your facts</p>
