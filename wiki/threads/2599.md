<p>Hello, I was wondering if someone could walk me through how to add a cube skybox into radiant. I have a Single DDS Cube Map, (.dds) file and i have 6 images (.png and .jpg). I don&#39;t know which would be better. I have seen a couple of tutorials on how to add a single panorama (.exr) but that has not helped. If someone could walk me through how to add it into APE and radiant, (or link me to a post that already has) that would be amazing. Thanks. :)</p>

<p>I always found the easiest way was to just convert it, take the images and align them like shown here, and pass it through the generator.<br /><a href="https://www.360toolkit.co/convert-cubemap-to-spherical-equirectangular">Cubemap -&gt; Panorama</a></p>

I keep getting these errors in ape<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.20.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "Capture2.PNG"</a><br />and in radiant it looks like this.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.21.png' | relative_url }}"><br />how can I fix this?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Did you forget to change the image type back because it&#39;s not a cubemap anymore?</p>

<p>I Have it set to Texture image type in the image asset and it is still giving me these errors<br />ERROR:Invalid cube image size (8192x4096) for image&#39;texture_assets\custom\custom_skybox\complex_purple_nebula\purple_nebula_complex1.exr&#39;<br />ERROR:Image type mismatch for &#39;skybox_test_3_ft&#39; in material &#39;mtl_skybox_test_3&#39;<br /><br />Followed multiple tutorials, don&#39;t know how this is not working. Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Check the other skyboxes provided, make sure its set to HDR at the very least: <br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.24.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br />I&#39;ve used the site Porter linked to convert MWR skyboxes to the format Bo3 uses and it worked fine, also make sure to set up a material and SSI (you can duplicate stock assets and tweak them to your needs). :)</p>

I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=RpHr5Np5rTc">Ice grenades tutorial</a> multiple times. If i gave you the image could someone make a gdt for me? That would be amazing so i could learn how to put sky boxes in myself. Thank you very much for your time. <br /><br />Images of skybox, and my settings in ape. <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TTtD9hDSv0nsErMUPd31rPMAQkwcSBhu">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TTtD9hDSv0nsErMUPd31rPMAQkwcSBhu</a><br /><br />P.S. I am am 99% sure that the skybox is copyright free. if you want to use it. <br />I got it here<br /><a href="http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape/">http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape/</a></p>
