<p>[COLOR=rgb(209, 213, 216)]A bunch of perk shaders I&#39;ve made in various styles.[/COLOR]<br />
[COLOR=rgb(239, 239, 239)]<span style="font-size:1.6em;">Classic Black Ops 1 Style</span>[/COLOR]<br /><br />[COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)]Here&#39;s a set of &quot;remastered&quot; BO1/WaW style perk and powerup shaders. I&#39;ve displayed the originals from BO1 alongside them for reference. The aim was to make them resemble their original counterparts as closely as possible, including 1:1 colours. I&#39;ve also added Black Ops 4&#39;s perks to the set and similarly applied the older-fashioned / desaturated look to them. Some are slightly redesigned, Bandolier Bandit being the only I did completely to better fit the style. Included as well are alternate versions of Juggernog, Double Tap, and Bandolier Bandit to choose from. <br /><br />Each source image is [/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(61, 142, 185)]128[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)]x[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(61, 142, 185)]128[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)].

<span style="font-size:1.6em;">[COLOR=rgb(239, 239, 239)]Black Ops 2 Style[/COLOR]</span><br /><br />[COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)]Here&#39;s a set of somewhat &quot;redux&quot; Black Ops 2 shaders. I made upscaled versions of those that were missing (Flopper, Deadshot, Who&#39;s Who, etc.), and thought I may as well release them together. Throughout there are subtle adjustments that thought might improve them, including adjusted Staminup and Electric Cherry, as well as colour adjustments to Vulture Aid (so as to differentiate it from Double Tap as they used the same base image originally). I also decided to include the &quot;Broken Earth&quot; versions of some, i.e. what they looked like pre-MOTD, for the craic like, to breath at least a bit of new life into them. As before, there are some alternate versions to choose from, like Juggernog and a BO3 style colour addition to powerups. Originals are displayed here where appropriate for reference. <br /><br />Each source image is [/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(84, 172, 210)]64[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)]x[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(84, 172, 210)]64[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(204, 204, 204)], as they were in BO2. <br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yw2rnP6.png"><br /><br />Black Ops 4&#39;s alongside some the existing ones.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/I7TefZE.png"><br /><br />Some more community perks.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/sdp9kJN.png"><br /><br />Some of the alternate versions to choose from for certain perks.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/4iHJhCh.png">[/COLOR]<br /><br />

<p>this is awesome!!! thank you :D I&#39;m trying to get the death machine one to work on my map, but for some reason it&#39;s the only one that doesn&#39;t want to :( I&#39;ve got it reading: <br /><br />image,t7_hud_zm_powerup_giant_deathmachine3<br /><br />(that&#39;s what I named it in APE), is there something I&#39;m missing? :o Again though, thanks for these! they&#39;re awesome!!</p>

You can actually check the official one that&#39;s in APE already if you want to double check too, just search for it in there. Also, thanks, glad you like them!</p>

What I did was duplicate the official one and set that image to the custom, and then wrote in that image, the *t7_hud_zm_powerup_giant_deathmachine3* so I think I did something wrong haha. The reason I did that was it wouldn&#39;t allow me to create one with the same name. Is it okay to change the image for the official one?</p>

It&#39;s actually the only way to change it at the moment, well until someone figures out how to properly remake the powerup widget/container to allow you to set custom images a different way. Since it&#39;s gdt is present in APE, overwriting the name like the others doesn&#39;t work so you have to edit the source, you can back up the original one too if you&#39;d like.</p>

<p>[USER=1745]@Ronan_M[/USER]<br />Could you plz do Amm-O-Matic? I&#39;m making a custom map and would love to use the Cold War shaders but there&#39;s no Amm-O-Matic yet.<br />Also could you make them DDS? For some reason when I install them, I get pixaly broken perk symbols.</p>

As far as I know, Amm-O-Matic isn&#39;t a perk but rather a machine that you can buy ammo at, unless it&#39;s a custom perk of course. How are you setting up the images in APE? There shouldn&#39;t be any issues with the image format.</p>

<p>[USER=1745]@Ronan_M[/USER] <br />Yes Amm-O-Matic is a custom perk.<br />I use them as a shader (vending_deadshot_shader for example) and when I run them, they break and they look awful. I realize, when it is pre-converted to DDS, it looks better.<br />That&#39;s why I asked if you could do a DDS version.</p>

Otherwise it might be a consequence of their resolution and the resampling when their resized in-game, in which case I&#39;ll just have to revert back to 128x128 like the older ones. Here&#39;s Amm-O-Matic for you:<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.1005.png' | relative_url }}"></p>

And yeah, maybe some day.</p>

<p>[USER=1745]@Ronan_M[/USER]<br />In the future, can you do a Banana Colada CW shader?<br />And is the pink BO1 shader Elemental Pop or something different? BC it looks like a classic take on the famous CW perk :).</p>

I&#39;ve no plans currently update the Cold War style as I think there&#39;s enough other people making them at the moment. I may revisit them in the future but not for now anyway.</p>

<p>Added a new Comic Book style to the post. <br /><br />Also removed the Cold War style since I wasn&#39;t particularly fond of how they turned out to begin with, plus I don&#39;t think they&#39;re necessary since there&#39;s plenty of other versions out there anyway like.</p>
