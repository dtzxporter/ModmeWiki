<p>If so, does anyone have a script to do it, or know how to do it?</p>

<p>From an old thread:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
zombie_utility::set_zombie_var( "player_base_health",     77 );{% endhighlight %}
<br />77 is apparently the base player health in BO3, and 50 makes it 2 hit down. Put this in your GSC under the function main and see how it goes. Lmk if it gets you errors.</p>

It&#39;s an idea I&#39;ve had to a horror themed map I&#39;m working on.</p>

Haven&#39;t test it myself.</p>
