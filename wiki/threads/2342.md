Make sure you&#39;re using the correct names though, which are:<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
weapon,pistol_luger
weapon,pistol_luger_upgraded{% endhighlight %}

I don&#39;t know how I managed to overlook that. The download has been updated and now includes all animations. Thanks for letting me know.</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />ok so its weapon,pistol_luger in the zone, but what about the weapon csv and in my gsc when im refering to the luger as my starting pistol? is it luger or pistol_luger? cause im getting this error after changing all references to pistol_luger instead of just luger:<br />{% highlight php %}
^3BG_LoadWeaponVariantDefFile: unable to locate asset in gdtdb for &#39;pistol_luger&#39;

<p>Reply By: Collie<br />Oh boy. You&#39;ll have to bear with me here, as I&#39;ve been working almost non-stop on modding for a few days now in an effort to get as much done before I start working again, so I&#39;ve had very little to no sleep. In the zone file you must always specify which game mode the weapon is being loaded for. In the case of zombies, you simply need to add _zm to the end of the weapon name (which corresponds to the full name of the weaponfile in the GDT). There&#39;s an example of how the zone file should look that was included with the download. I just checked, and it&#39;s actually correct for once. But, I&#39;ll post it here as well.<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
weapon,pistol_luger_zm
weapon,pistol_luger_upgraded_zm{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />In your script to change the starting weapon, you only need to refer to it by its&#39; short name, &quot;pistol_luger&quot;, and not &quot;pistol_luger_zm&quot;.</p>
