<p>Thread By: Wild<br />Hey, as some of you may or may not know from my last post, I have been learning to script. I have started my next few projects. The next project that I am started involves a random drop system, similar to how the Origins dig site have random drops. Basically what I am asking is in a script how to you make a list of items, have the script only choose one to spawn and have it be random and have the drop/item spawn at a specific point, for example at the origin of the trigger. I would assume for the list of items/drops you would use some sort of array I think and have the script pick 1 of them. So yeah, how do you set up the list, have one item randomly selected and then spawn at the origin of the trigger or a set point. Any help is appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>Reply By: Akrime<br />I&#39;d do something like this. Remember, if you&#39;re going to copy &amp; paste this code, you need to set the targetname for your trigger to &quot;droptrigger&quot;. If you need to add more drops to the array, just add them behind &quot;part_drop&quot; and seperate them with a blank space like in the code or delete the previous items.<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
// Array &amp; Variables
drops = strTok("grenade_falling_out weapon_drop part_drop "," ");
trigger GetEnt("droptrigger", "targetname");

// Hintstring
trigger setHintString("Press &amp;&amp;1 to get a random drop");

// Wait for the player to interact with the trigger
trigger waittill("trigger", player);

// Random picking
choosenDrop = array::random(drops);

// Then I&#39;d do something like this
switch(choosenDrop)
{
    case "grenade_falling_out":
    	// CODE: Do stuff, drop grenade from the drop etc..
    	break;

	case "weapon_drop":
		// CODE: spawn a weapon powerup for the player to pick up etc..
		break;

	case "part_drop":
		// CODE: spawn the part for the player to pick up etc..
		break;

	default:
		IPrintLn("ERROR: No case for this variable!");
		break;
}{% endhighlight %}
