<p>Thread By: UnwarylCaution<br /><p style="text-align:left;">The wardog perks do not properly line up with all of the other perks and does not use the bo2 perk shader I recently downloaded, how do you properly align the perks? and enable the wardog perks to use the shader also</p></p>

But if your shaders aren&#39;t working then you haven&#39;t installed them properly or the wardog addon isn&#39;t installed properly</p></p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br /><p style="text-align:left;">the shaders are easy to change, you look in wardogs GDTs &amp; find the image for them &amp; change them done. as for the alignment i have no clue what your talking about. are you talking about the perk HUD spacing or size or height?</p></p>
