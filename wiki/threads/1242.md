if(level.round_number == #){% endhighlight %}
 Use this as a &quot;flag&quot; I guess you could say, just pointing you towards the right direction.</p>

<p>Reply By: billdavison<br />I whipped something quickly I tested it it works, in the comments I tried explaning  it the best I could but it works and there are things that need to be modified so your door moves where you want it but remember to  thread setting_up_the_door(); in your main function I hopped this helped<br />{% highlight php %}
// make sure you thread setting_up_the_door(); in the main function in your mapname.gsc

// this is for somthing
function  setting_up_the_door()
{

 
//fyi the word level used in scripts means i can use that variable in any functions fyi
//this is setting the targetname of the trigger_use in radiant as door_trig
 level.door_trig = GetEnt("door_trig", "targetname");
 level.door_trig SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_trig UseTriggerRequireLookAt();
 level.door_trig SetHintString("this door will open after round 3"); //type what ever your heart desires anything around these lines or this door will magically open lol i dk/ this is what the door says
// now you need to set up the script_model&#39;s targetname  to door_model1 in radiant

 level.door_model1 = GetEnt("door_model1", "targetname");
 level.door_model1 SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_model1 UseTriggerRequireLookAt();
 
 // this sets up a second door,now you need to set up a second  script_model&#39;s targetname  to door_model2 in radiant
 
 level.door_model2 = GetEnt("door_model2", "targetname");
 level.door_model2 SetCursorHint("HINT_NOICON");
 level.door_model2 UseTriggerRequireLookAt();





while(1)
 {

if (level.round_number == 3)
   {

	thread openthedoors();
	break;
	wait (.01);
   }
    wait(.01);

 }



}


function openthedoors() 

{
 level.door_trig Delete();
 level.door_model1 MoveY(-100,6); // change the x to  y or z if you want the door to move in a different direction , do some playing around to figure out where you want to move your doors to move
 level.door_model2 MoveY(56,6);
 
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />when deleting a barrier you need to use<br /><br /><br />{% highlight php %}
entity connectPaths();{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />on it first before deleting it or zombies will not path ( also tick dynamic paths of the entity in the kvps in radiant )<br /> <br />also if it leads into another zone, you also need to set the flag for that zone so it activates<br /> <br /> <br />also, the shortest possible wait in gsc is 0.05 not 0.01 ( 0.01 is the shortest possible wait in csc however )</p>

<p>Reply By: noVADex<br />Thanks guys this was all very helpful, never had any issues with zombie pathing after deleting the entities, but i did use a multi trigger with touch zone activation on the other side of the clip/brush. <br />Cheers</p>

I wouldn&#39;t of posted anything till I had it tested and working.<br />My only concern at this point is having the zone past the door not trigger if the player dosnt walk up to the area the door was. so as to trigger the trig behind the deleted door, but the kvp script_flag on the original door and trigger dont take effect, unless you have a suggestion for that.</p>

I am stating facts -the pathing works, so that info isn&#39;t helpful at this time.

I&#39;ve always only used the kvp on a trigger. Although i have attempted to use what i know from waw and also what i can figure out from the code ive seen. Yes, it makes it past the linker, but doesn&#39;t work in game or causes a error during loading. Knowing that line of code for activating a zone would actually be very helpful, and im sure many wouldn&#39;t argue that point.<br />Thanks again</p>

I am actually testing and using the code, obviously your not. Even the original answer of script from billdavison works and has correct pathing, again i tested it too.You would know this if you tried them. No i did not attempt any zone activation during those original tests.<br />again i say, thank you for your great effort.</p>
