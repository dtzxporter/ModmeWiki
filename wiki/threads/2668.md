<p><span style="font-size:1.7em;"><strong>[COLOR=rgb(44, 130, 201)]ThomasCat&#39;s Characters for BOIII[/COLOR]</strong></span><br /><br />Hey, I decided I would post some of my characters I have ported to BO3 so they can be used in custom maps. If they are used please credit the following people:<br />
<ul><li>ThomasCat - Porting the characters<br /><li>Scobalula - Greyhound, CodMayaTools and various other tools<br /><li>DtzxPorter - Original Wraith source code<br /><li>Aiden - CodMayaTools<br /><li>Maciej - CodMayaTools<br /></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

<br /><br /><span style="font-size:1.6em;">Characters:</span><br /><br />
The myth, the legend, Soap MacTavish! This character has featured in MW1 MW2 and MW3, but you may not know that he was also in Ghosts as DLC! Thanks to M5_Prodigy, I was able to get the assets without having to pay for the DLC myself so I could port him to BO3. Therefore, you must credit M5_Prodigy in addition to the people mentioned in &quot;Credits&quot;. This character replaces Richtofen so any other character that replaces Richtofen will cause conflicts and could break your APE and your map will not compile so keep that in mind. This character has voxes from MW2 SP and some generic voxes from MW2 MP.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ly0_eTXoyvY" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!MsoUiA5J!IijjpTtL5Z3sn1LMEeNFSJmpEhzz8-b32r2nfZBbcfU">Download</a><br /><br />

Camouflage. A call back to the original CoD4 missions. Perfect if you want to make a grassy land map, not so much for entire maps made out of concrete. These characters are made using MWR assets so should be pretty good quality. This character replaces Takeo so make sure you don&#39;t have any other characters that replace Takeo otherwise you will run into conflicts.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yB2VRT0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvJATo9" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!QxQlhQrb!GE6jQzUKe-gf19qvuimVAXF1PvdKKSQ9qvFC5k5xFfA">Download</a><br /><br />

Protect yourself against volatile chemicals with the all new CDC Hazmat characters! Perfect to protect against Nova 6 gas. Also, the first characters I&#39;ve ever released to have properly rigged multiple wrist twists thanks to my good friend Scobalula. He has been given money for a coffee in return. Make sure to clap those alien cheeks responsibly.<br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lugmA4" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JehNLLD" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/N2xa3pg.png">https://i.imgur.com/N2xa3pg.png</a><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!0lwV2CTZ!Jatk0I3xTR27dvRh34akBFUPl4v7V63ayEwnBzaE1js">Download</a><br /><br /><br />

Military privates unknowingly thrown into a zombie apocalypse. What a fantastic idea for a zombies map! Oh wait, it was done 10 years ago. Well, because of this I used the WaW Voice quotes for the marines. Also, I released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1822984779">mod</a> with these characters in with some other differences (Such as USA MP Announcer from WaW). Special thanks to TheBlackDeath for helping me with the voxes and IamMrSpeedy for getting some screenshots for me while I was unavailable.<br /><br />[ATTACH=full]152[/ATTACH]<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.153.jpg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.155.jpeg' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!Yp40kaxL!rmxF3J08um07JVE7gfrLlChyqBkifxW-ctHv-G5cz4w">Download</a><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Finally released these. Put them off packaging for a while since I thought I had more to do but turns out they where 100% done. Whoops. Have fun. Includes voxes. BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT TO HAVE ANY OTHER CHARACTERS INSTALLED WHEN INSTALLING THESE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.283.png' | relative_url }}"><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!ttIxVIYD!tir5hHP0lTMHxcjM5eMUFoAN_3Gk7AFDFdCwfK12Vks">Download</a><br /><br /><a href="https://mega.nz/file/HA9hmBBA#C_4MsBAYGcWzMc2BqwQ7tv5bT8HRKSHmah9KpU4seK4">if you dont have the textures use these</a><br />^ credit to LordDebino or whatever the fuck he goes by now since i couldnt be fucked to set them up<br /><br />

<p>Hi [USER=40]@ThomasCat[/USER] <br />I&#39;ve got a question:<br /><br />I&#39;ve a custom playermodel rigged and all. The way I did it was just took a rig from Dempsey using wraith and put it in my models.<br />Works fine but the models look a little bugy and is because of the skin weight, I think xD<br /><br />So what I mean is, can I ask you for help to do correctly the weight for my custom playermodel?<br />If not that&#39;s ok, don&#39;t worry</p>

Still doesn&#39;t show up in-game :/<br /><br />Edit: FIXED IT! Go to root/zone_source/all/assetlist/core_common.csv then delete all the lines that are included in the readme (same ones that go in your zone). It must&#39;ve used that instead idk.

<p>Hey, I&#39;ve just added the ZC characters into my map, but the textures on the bodies of both Dempsey and Nikolai are messed up. Also, the voxes are not playing at all. Is there something I&#39;m missing, as I followed all of the instructions?</p>

<p>Hey! These ports are awesome. I would love if you ported Captain Price and Ghost from MW2, I&#39;ve wanted to port them myself but I&#39;m bad at that crap. If you could, Price could replace Dempsey, and Ghost could replace Nikolai. If you did this, I would have a complete set of MW characters for my crew. I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m forcing you to do this, I would just love to see it.</p>

<br />I&#39;ve added the files from the updated RAR file into my BO3 root, but the character models aren&#39;t in game, it just uses the default Primis characters.<br />The voxes work fine though<br /></blockquote><br />I am having the exact same issue, if I install the patch files that you released for the ZCR characters the models just quit appearing.</p>

<p>I am also having a problem with the ZC Characters. Richtofen and Takeo both work perfectly, but Nikolai and Dempsey have missing textures when loading into a game. Anyone know a fix for this?</p>
