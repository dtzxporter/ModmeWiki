<p>Thread By: modric<br />A while back I messed with the level common for my first map and added some weapons and it worked perfectly. I am now working on a second map and cannot get my either my first maps weapons table or my new table that i made. It loads the default one and none of my custom wallbuys work.<br /> <br /> <br />I added level._zombie_custom_add_weapons =&amp;custom_add_weapons; and <br />function custom_add_weapons()<br />{<br /> zm_weapons::load_weapon_spec_from_table(&quot;zm_diner/gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelkrovi_weapons.csv&quot;, 1);<br />} to my gsc,<br /> <br />and added   function custom_add_weapons()<br />{<br />zm_weapons::load_weapon_spec_from_table(&quot;zm_diner/gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelkrovi_weapons.csv&quot;, 1);<br />}     to my csc.<br /> <br />i also added stringtable,zm_diner/gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelkrovi_weapons.csv to my zone.<br /> <br /> <br />I have the new table in the same folder as the default and i also made a gamedata folder in my usermap to accomadate the weapon table and that also did nothing.</p>
