<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />I did some testing and basically all you need to do is copy the wunderwaffe scripts (_zm_weap_tesla.gsc/csc) to your mapname/scripts/zm folder and in the beginning of the scripts you will see 2 lines where the gun and the upgraded version are defined. Change the gun names to your gun.<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
function init()
{
	level.weaponZMTeslaGun = GetWeapon( "pistol_standard" );
	level.weaponZMTeslaGunUpgraded = GetWeapon( "pistol_standard_upgraded" );
{% endhighlight %}
 also add the scripts to the zone file<br /> <br />PS. This will only work on projectile guns not bulletweapons. If you have dual weapons, only the right one will work.</p>
