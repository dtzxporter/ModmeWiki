<p>Thread By: TCM<br />I know there used to be a way to change the round through the level.round_number but from what I can see that no longer works, I am just wondering if it is at all possible to change the round through GSC?</p>

<p>Reply By: TCM<br />Also the only problem I see with that is when you do lets say pay 1,000 to skip round and they wanna skip 10 rounds level.current_round does not increase even if you +1 it/</p>

Its very odd behavior indeed <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://modme.co/emoticons/wassat.png"> <br /> <br />Aslo no where does this say its a &quot;helping&quot; forum as you put it. Just a &quot;forum&quot; - which is a place to talk and discuss. Not a majestic paradise where only answers may be provided<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and theres no problem<br /> <br />its <br /> <br />[CODE=php]level.round_number[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />and it does increase</p>
