<p>Thread By: maxman5050<br />How would i implement something that the player would need to go into a certain zone. Like on moon with the PES, if you go outside without it you die</p>

<p>Reply By: modric<br />Using a trig multiple scripted to apply damage to players in that trig would be a good start</p>

<p>Reply By: KillJoyYT<br />I can give some assistance but you have to be a lot more specific about what you&#39;re trying to accomplish</p>

 <br />Not sure if the above code works... or is the most efficient lol. Be sure to insert your own kvp&#39;s :p</p>

<p>Reply By: maxman5050<br />does there have to be a thread in the main function?</p>

<p>Reply By: KillJoyYT<br />yeah under your usermap main put <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
level thread gas_mask_init();{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br />haven&#39;t had time to test will take a look later tonight</p>
