<p>Thread By: changcow<br />In my map zones work perfectly and zombies don&#39;t spawn til they&#39;re opened and it&#39;s all fine and dandy. The problem is that I thought zombies would only spawn one or two adjacent zones away but they&#39;re still spawning on the other side of the map with like 3 zones distance and takes forever on lower rounds. Is this part of that game and is there any way to fix this?<br />Thanks,<br />ChangCow</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />They aren&#39;t 100% properly set up then. They should only be spawning in the adjacent zones that connect the zone you&#39;re in.</p>

So I changed that to a init_zone instead and that fixed it. Thanks for the help <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="http://aviacreations.com/modme/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
