Treyarch hasn&#39;t had wallrunning zombies before, if I call correctly. This would be pretty difficult to implement, especially if they need to attack while wallrunning also, which is probably why Treyarch never did it.<br /> <br />If you need zombies to get to an isolated part of the map, you can always use traversals however.</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />Pretty much, i was really mainly talking about the wall running part of his question, i didn&#39;t really bother about pointing out the fact that they&#39;d look like fully functioning humans in the process</p>

<p>Reply By: Fil he Modder<br />Well, a traversal probably may not allow the zombies to hit while wall running, but there may be a trigger on the wall that would allow the zombies to wall run and not be restricted to only walrun. It&#39;d most likely be required for him make his own animation of a wall running zombie hit, but if he doesn&#39;t care too much, then he can just use the npc first punch anims</p>
