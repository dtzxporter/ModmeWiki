I will give 100% credit when i publish the map.</blockquote><br /> Here you go.<br /> <br />Test Footage/Demonstration:<br />(Note: I made it into one function since then for simplicity)<br /> <iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZjJhesZ_ag" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /> <br />Instructions:<br /> <br />1. Open your map&#39;s gsc file. Go to: <br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\your_map\scripts\zm\your_map.gsc<br /> <br />2. Put this in your map gsc&#39;s main() function. Near the bottom should suffice. Calls the function.<br />    - Replace this with the round number you want everything to be shown at.<br />{% highlight php %}
level thread show_at_round();{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />3. Add this function to your map&#39;s gsc file. It is filled with an example for a prefab, a model, and a brushmodel. <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}

 <br />4. This is where things vary. I have examples above. Add as many as you need.<br />    a) If you want to to do this to a prefab:<br />          1. Go into prefab within Radiant.<br />          2. Make sure everything within the prefab is a script_model or script_brushmodel.<br />          3. Have nothing selected and press I to select everything.<br />          4. Give it a unique targetname.<br />          5. Go into your gsc file.<br />          6. In the Hiding Things section (I have provided an example):<br />                    1. Get all the entities with that targetname.<br />                    2. Use a for-loop to hide all of those entities.<br />          <br />          7. In the Show Things section (I have provided an example):<br />                    1. Use a for-loop to show all of those entities.<br />          8. Do this for all prefabs you have.<br /> <br />    b) If you want to to do this to a model or brushmodel:<br />          1. Select entity within Radiant.<br />          2. Make sure it is a script_model or script_brushmodel..<br />          3. Give it a unique targetname.<br />          4. Go into your gsc file.<br />          5. In the Hiding Things section (I have provided an example):<br />                    1. Get the entity with that targetname.<br />                    2. Use hide function to hide the entity.<br />          <br />          6. In the Show Things section (I have provided an example):<br />                    1. Use hide function to show the entity.<br />          7. Do this for all entities you have.<br /> <br /> <br />If you need help, just ask. I have tried my best to provide a template.</p>
