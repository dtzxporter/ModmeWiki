My question was more about how to make or edit those fx files because it&#39;s not done in APE as far as I can tell. So this fx is a green light, but how would I make an fx file that is a different color light for example.</p>

In this case you only have 1 (Light (Name of the part)).<br /> <br /> <br />Then go into FX Properties/Visuals and make sure it&#39;s set to Dynamic Light. If you&#39;re starting from scratch make sure the spawn and death times are set up in Generation<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/LmC83XJ.png"><br /> <br /> <br />Finally go into FX Graph. Select Color and change it. Pull the black dots to change the color from the beginning of its lifespan to the end. You can middleclick in between to add points (and select+backspace to delete them). You can also click on the bar at the bottom to choose from the palette. <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/gu6YnSb.png"></p>
