<p>Currently using buyable ending from ugxmods. It has an option to change the game over text, but that feature doesnt seem to work for me. Does anyone have a buyable ending script/mod that can replace the &quot;game over&quot; text? Thanks!</p>

<p>Did you add your end game text to this at the top? It should work for you.<br />{% highlight php %}
#define ENDGAME_CUSTOM_GAME_OVER    "your text here"{% endhighlight %}
If you have ugx&#39;s timed gameplay installed, make sure your game over text isn&#39;t being set by that also</p>

<p>That line of code came with the ugxmods_buyable_ending.gsc<br /><br />I tried changing it and it didnt work. It just used the default game over. I don&#39;t believe I have the timed gameplay installed.<br /><br />/*<br />    Created by Andy King (treminaor) for UGX-Mods.com. &#169; UGX-Mods 2016<br />    Please include credit if you use this script and do not distribute edited versions of it without my permission.<br />    Instructions: <a href="https://confluence.ugx-mods.com/display/UGXMODS/BO3+%7C+Adding+Buyable+Ending+to+Zombiemode">https://confluence.ugx-mods.com/display/UGXMODS/BO3+|+Adding+Buyable+Ending+to+Zombiemode</a><br />    Version 1.0 10/15/2016 12:55PM<br />*/<br /><br />#using scripts\shared\flag_shared;<br />#using scripts\zm\_zm_score;<br />#define ENDGAME_WAIT_FOR_FLAG           &quot;&quot; //if you want the ending to require a flag to be set from another script you have, enter the flag here.<br />#define ENDGAME_WAIT_FOR_NOTIFY         &quot;&quot; //if you want the ending to require a level notify to be sent from another script you have, enter the notify string here.<br />#define ENDGAME_COST                    0 //how much should it cost to end the game?<br />#define ENDGAME_CUSTOM_GAME_OVER        &quot;Lmao ez game I aint even sweatin&quot; //Do you want to replace the &quot;GAME OVER&quot; text?
