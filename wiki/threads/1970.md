<p>Thread By: Gordo1920<br />Whenever I try to run my custom map on black ops 3, it says, &quot;Black Ops 3.exe has stopped working&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if there is something wrong with my GSC files or anything else that is connected to my map. If anyone has a suggestion to why this is happening it would be greatly appreciated. <strong>-Gordo</strong></p>

When in Radiant, I had to manually run the map for bo3 and not check any of the boxes. Anyway thanks and this might be of good use in the future.</p>
