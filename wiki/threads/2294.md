When the zombie reaches another smaller, inner radius, or if it gets too far away from the player, it is sped back up. </span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;"></span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Sounds complicated? Basically it just slows zombies when they get too close, but won&#39;t slow them down when they start hitting you. This gives players extra time before zombies can hit them, and can really save the player in some sticky situations, but not all.</span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;"></span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Snail&#39;s Pace Slurpee comes with a re-textured speed-cola machine model (Though an actual <strong>original</strong> model is in the works right now!), as well as it&#39;s own shader, bottle, FX, Vulture Aid Waypoint, and even perk jingle.</span><br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">How Do I Install It In My Map?</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">The download includes instructions for installation within the instructions.txt file.</span><br /> <br /><strong><span style="color:#ffffff;">IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HARRYBO21&#39;S PERKS (v2.1 or higher) INSTALLED FIRST!!!</span></strong><br /><strong><span style="color:#ffffff;"></span></strong><br /><span style="color:#0fdb75;"></span><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shaders</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;"><a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=forumprofile&uid=1445">Lethal Peelz</a> and <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=forumprofile&uid=918">Erthrock</a> have both made shader sets that include Snail&#39;s Pace. If you are interested in trying out some new shaders for Snail&#39;s Pace I recommend checking them out.</span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Lethal Peelz Shaders: <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1838">http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=1838</a></span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Erthrock Shaders: <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=2296">http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&amp;tid=2296</a></span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">In order to change the shader, you&#39;ll have to edit the customperkicons.lua (located in Root/usermaps/yourmapname/ui/uieditor/widgets/hud/zm_perks). You must change this line:</span><br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
snails_pace 						= "i_snails_pace_shader"{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />so it is set equal to whatever IMAGE (not material anymore) asset you want to be the shader.<br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">NOTES</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">If you happen to make custom perks too, Snail&#39;s pace uses the specialty: &quot;specialty_gpsjammer&quot;, so I recommend not using that, if you want it to be compatible with Snail&#39;s Pace. </span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">A new model for Snail&#39;s Pace is currently in the works, so it can have an original model instead of just retextured Speed Cola</span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">You can change many of the settings of Snail&#39;s Pace within the _zm_perk_snails_pace_slurpee.gsh including a new feature that slows down zombies exceptionally when a player with Snail&#39;s Pace goes down.</span><br /> <br />Maps that I made (you betcha they got Snail&#39;s Pace in &#39;em): <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1220856535">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1220856535</a><br /> <br />THERE IS SUCH A THING AS THE <span style="color:#0fdb75;">SNAIL&#39;S PACE SLURPEE MOD!</span> It adds Snail&#39;s Pace to Treyarch maps and has the capability to add it to other custom maps too! check it out: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1242962197">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1242962197</a><br /> <br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Credits</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">PLEASE CREDIT THESE PEOPLE IF YOU AREN&#39;T ALREADY!</span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">-Abnormal202</span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">-NSZ</span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">-Harrybo21</span><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">-Frost Iceforge</span><br /> <br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">Read everything?

<p>Reply By: WARDOGSK93<br />Nice perk and release, happy to see people actually using my &#39;Addon&#39; system for what its meant to be used for :D<br /><br />But yeah about my &#39;Addon&#39; System that won&#39;t be returning to ModMe, it has been replaced with my new &#39;Compat&#39; System, pretty exactly the same thing but rescripted and no longer needs edits to MAPNAME::main, now to include it you just add a 2 lines of code to MAPNAME<br /> <br />I would recommend updating to my latest version, if you do update please not that none of my old addons will work with this system as of now, <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=720">Click here</a><br /> <br />If you want to know how to set up and use this system, <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1285">Click here</a><br /> <br />Also when you release anything that uses my core scripts (or anything for that matter), could you release them without my scripts in your download and tell people to goto my forum post and install from there, I know when you made this my Core Scripts were down but could you do this in the future, thanks :D</p>

I didn&#39;t include any of your files for the extra perks btw, just the core scripts. I still told everyone to credit you, so hopefully they will listen...</p>

<p>Reply By: easyskanka<br />One thing you left out in the instructions, you need to add this line to your mapname CSC as well as the GSC to get this to work,<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
#using scripts\zm\_zm_perk_snails_pace_slurpee; {% endhighlight %}
 <br />If you dont you will end up getting a client mismatch error and you wont be able to load your map, apart from that it works brilliant in game - good job sir!</p>

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s big enough to re-upload the download, but I will mention that in the post.</p>

I&#39;ve been meaning to for awhile. The only reason Snail&#39;s Pace can&#39;t stand alone is because of the different way they do shaders.</p>

But I didn&#39;t want to include anything someone else made in my download.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />ATTENTION!<br /> <br />I have updated Snail&#39;s Pace Slurpee to work with Harry&#39;s new perk system that uses LUA.<br /> <br />You&#39;ll need to use this new version if you want the snail&#39;s pace shader to display with the rest of Harry&#39;s new perks.<br /> <br />It also contains a new feature which you can edit in the .gsh that activates when a player with snail&#39;s pace goes down.<br /> <br />Let me know if I&#39;m missing anything in the download.</p>

And yet it doesn&#39;t seem to be working... I&#39;ve tried some stuff and haven&#39;t got it to work so far. I&#39;ll look into it some more. Normally I&#39;d contact Harry but he&#39;s kinda &quot;off the modding community grid&quot; as of right now.<br /> <br />Everything else <strong>should</strong> work as far as the perk. Please let me know if something else isn&#39;t working right or I forgot to include something in the download, but as far as my testing I believe everything&#39;s good.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />its a normal standard old array... that you add perks specialty names to... which i did &quot;not&quot; create, it was already there... which is also identical the way it was in bo2s scripts - which you also have... which is also covered on the wiki<br /> <br /> <br />theres nothing special about my function, and one already exists in the fizz script, and as i just said, you merely need to add to the existing array...<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
function include_perk_in_random_rotation( perk )
{
	if ( !IsDefined( level._random_perk_machine_perk_list ) )
	{
		level._random_perk_machine_perk_list = [];
	}

	ARRAY_ADD( level._random_perk_machine_perk_list, perk );
}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />^ directly from treyarchs script, which you obviously didnt read<br /><br /><br /> <br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.gyazo.com/da1d98b9ccd3b532d59cbf8399cffae2.png"><br /> <br />^ From the wiki - which you obviously didnt read<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
function add_perk_to_wunderfizz( perk )
{
	if ( !isDefined( level._random_perk_machine_perk_list ) )
		level._random_perk_machine_perk_list = [];
	
	if ( isDefined( level._random_perk_machine_perk_list ) &amp;&amp; level._random_perk_machine_perk_list.size &gt; 0 )
	{
		for ( i = 0; i &lt; level._random_perk_machine_perk_list.size; i++ )
		{
			if ( level._random_perk_machine_perk_list[ i ] === perk )
				return;
		
		}
	}
	
	level._random_perk_machine_perk_list[ level._random_perk_machine_perk_list.size ] = perk;
}{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />^ my function - only difference is mine prevents a perk being added &quot;more than once&quot; which again you obviously didnt read...<br /> <br /> <br />if youd actually looked into it you would have worked this out :<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
level._random_perk_machine_perk_list[ level._random_perk_machine_perk_list.size ] = "specialty_whatever";{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Also people i didnt make a perk &quot;system&quot; i just added to treyarchs and cleaned the code on the existing 8 ( 9 for cherry ) perks<br /> <br />I didnt make the lua stuff either, porter patched it to allow more, all i did was make the array for it easier to get to - so this isnt to &quot;make it work with harrys&quot; its to &quot;make it work with the stock perk setup by treyarch which harry also uses&quot;<br /> <br />...and i didnt make the wunderfizz, its in your mod tools. My modification just reenables code treyarch commented out, adds a couple of the missing fx and missing sounds</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />should also fix the at least 10 different developer mode errors too<br /> <br /> <br />first example - zombie gets slowed - zombie is then killed during the 3 second cooldown<br /> <br />&quot;unable to set entity moverate on undefined&quot;<br /> <br />coz you didnt kill the thread, and when the zombie died, he becomes &quot;undefined&quot; - and you dont kill the thread if they walk to the &quot;inner circle&quot; either meaning your double setting the same moverate<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />another is your &quot;explode&quot; function on players that straight up &quot;died&quot; like fell off a building and get kicked straight to spectator. Coz your not using the &quot;on last stand callback&quot; - or checking if the player is still alive but downed - your just using &quot;when perk is lost&quot; ( which also means if people use the power that can be turned off, or any other reason a/all perks could be lost ( like astroman on moon ) - they are going to explode )<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This entire thing would also conflict with widows wine, and the paralyser - or infact any examples of anything else adjusting asm moverate ( example, zombie walks close, gets slowed by this, zombie hits you, another zombie hits you, your widows explodes, this first zombie gets webbed, but whenever your cooldown finishes - prob like a second later - that &quot;webbed zombie&quot; is just suddenly gonna take off at full speed despite still being &quot;webbed by widows&quot; - nullifying BOTH perks and creating a potential unexpected and lethal event )<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />any indication this perk has done anything at all would be good too, like a sound, an fx, anything.

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Okay I made the bottle look nicer, and made it a proper weapon so now Snail&#39;s pace will use it&#39;s own bottle when you buy it and when it appears in the wunderfizz.

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Also yeah making a good custom perk isn&#39;t easy and that&#39;s why there aren&#39;t as many as you might think. There&#39;s a reason Treyarch stopped making them after Widow&#39;s Wine, after all. A lot of ideas have already been explored and you don&#39;t want to make something redundant.<br /> <br />That being said I&#39;ve made some in my time and have some ideas for the future. Currently I have 3 working custom perks (though only two have been released in maps so far). I&#39;m thinking of releasing Cryo-Slide Soda from my map <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1190597493">Frostbite</a> soon, but I&#39;ve got some issues to sort with it first.<br /> <br />idk I could probably get a lot more of my custom perk ideas working and released to the public if I focused my time on that. Not that many people seem interested in them though, so I usually find myself scripting an easter egg than making a custom perk.</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />Okay hopefully the last update for this for awhile (who knows anymore though). I cleaned up the code so it should be more reliable and doesn&#39;t use any sort of 3 second delay nonsense. <br /> <br />More importantly, I decided to add an eye fx that zombies who are slowed will show. I based this off of <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=1047">Frost Iceforge&#39;s custom eyes</a> so that&#39;s why I added Frost Iceforge to the credits. I was skeptical at first, but I think changing the zombies&#39; eyes actually works pretty well for it, though I left an option in the .gsh to turn it off if you want.</p>

BECAUSE I SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP AT THIS POINT.<br /> <br />I realized Snail&#39;s Pace didn&#39;t have a Vulture Aid waypoint fx, So I made one. Hence --v2.21--<br /> <br />If there&#39;s anything else separating this perk from a Treyarch one, let me know.</p>

 <br /> <br />^ Still not allowing for zombies dying inbetween<br /><br /><br />also this will still conflict with widows, but worse yet, will conflict with &quot;itself&quot; if more than one person has the perk<br /> <br /> <br />if the players next to you dies, and thus explodes, its gonna un&quot;snail&quot; zombies effected by you - and vice versa as your globally checking every 0.05 seconds against players that have the perk.<br /> <br /> <br />^ This means<br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
// iteration for player 1

zombie is in range - slow him

// Your not breaking the check here so...

// continue to player 2 - whos on the other side of the map and thus out of range

zombie is NOT in range - unslow him immediatly{% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br />Also this will break completely if a zombie gets slowed by this perk, then that player goes down and loses the perk ( or the perk is paused by power being turned off ) - and no one else has it either. The zombie will remain permanently slowed OR if another player with the perk is there and runs away - they will again become instantly unslowed - AND not kill the old thread<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Your still not checking if the player still exists before executing your explode code either, so instant death triggers of any kind will cause a random explosion &quot;somewhere&quot; ( prob at 0, 0, 0 ) and the &quot;self.origin&quot; check in the explode code will default on to level.origin so likely effect &quot;every single zombie on the map&quot;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />your eye code is also going to forcefully add back eye fx to boss zombies who explicitly have their standard eye fx disabled, which will also cause a issue with the fx appearing on their feet in the case of t6 or t5 bosses<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />that code was VERY broken for co-op. I&#39;ve changed the code and tested it on co-op and I think it works fine now.

That way Snail&#39;s Pace only overrides it for things that don&#39;t slow zombies as much as Snail&#39;s Pace would.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />the problem is other scripts &quot;unsetting&quot; the rate, not just yours changing theirs<br /> <br /> <br />&quot;the proper way&quot; to fix this, would be to write a bridge function for setEntityAnimRate<br /> <br /> <br />and have the users find and replace references to it, then handle whatever within your bridge version<br /> <br /> <br />{% highlight php %}
function _setEntityAnimRate( n_rate, b_is_higher_priority == false ){% endhighlight %}
 <br /> <br /> <br />^ example, then they can find and replace one with the other</p>

<p>Reply By: kaizokuroof<br />Hey, I&#39;ve used your perk in other custom maps! Very cool and unique idea. I&#39;d like to use this perk in my map, however, it says in the instructions that you need Harry BO21 perks, which are sadly not available in his thread. Is there another location to get these files, or is there anyone willing to reupload them, as without them it seems I won&#39;t be able to include it in my map :(</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br /><blockquote><em>kaizokuroof</em><br />Hey, I&#39;ve used your perk in other custom maps! Very cool and unique idea. I&#39;d like to use this perk in my map, however, it says in the instructions that you need Harry BO21 perks, which are sadly not available in his thread.

The main downside is the shader for Snail&#39;s Pace has to be displayed separately from the normal perks, but other than that it&#39;s pretty much the same.</p>

<p>Reply By: Riptide1106<br />Hi Abnormal, <br />First off, thanks for providing this great perk to the community! I have a question (problem) about this perk, I&#39;m hoping you can help with. Whatever perks i get before snails, remain on the hud after going down and getting revived (i don&#39;t still have the perks just the shaders remain). The perks gotten after snails i lose as expected, just the perks gotten prior are affected. Any ideas as to what is causing this?<br /> <br />ps. im using the (no harrys perks 2.2.5 version)<br /> <br />Thanks for your help =)</p>

When the zombie reaches another smaller, inner radius, or if it gets too far away from the player, it is sped back up. <br /><br />Sounds complicated? Basically it just slows zombies when they get too close, but won&#39;t slow them down when they start hitting you. This gives players extra time before zombies can hit them, and can really save the player in some sticky situations, but not all.<br /><br />Snail&#39;s Pace Slurpee comes with a re-textured speed-cola machine model (Though an actual <strong>original</strong> model is in the works right now!), as well as it&#39;s own shader, bottle, FX, Vulture Aid Waypoint, and even perk jingle.</span><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">How Do I Install It In My Map?</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;">The download includes instructions for installation within the instructions.txt file.</span><br /><br /><strong><span style="color:#ffffff;">IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HARRYBO21&#39;S PERKS (v2.1 or higher) INSTALLED FIRST!!!</span></strong><br /><br /><br />&lt;h3&gt;<strong><span style="color:#0fdb75;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shaders</span></span></strong>&lt;/h3&gt;<br /><br /><span style="color:#ffffff;"><a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=forumprofile&uid=1445">Lethal Peelz</a> and <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=forumprofile&uid=918">Erthrock</a> have both made shader sets that include Snail&#39;s Pace.

<p>I certainly like the custom perk in various custom maps. But I usually find the illustration quite lacking in terms of being refined like the Treyarch&#39;s perk and etc. So I thought I&#39;d redraw it just for fun~ ^^<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.791.png' | relative_url }}"></p>
