<p>Thread By: PyroFlames<br />Alright so i just recently added a couple scripts and everything worked, then did a bit more mapping and couldn&#39;t load my map anymore. It still compiles fine but when i try to run it i just get a black screen at 36fps and nothing ever happends. Could someone maybe point me in the right direction here because I&#39;m quite confused. This is quite a large map so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see I missed something.<br />Compiler Log,<br />{% highlight php %}

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />Try just removing the models that are listed as errors and try again.</p>

<p>Reply By: PyroFlames<br />Well figured out it was script related somehow, commented out all the non-essential gsc, csc, zone functions and the like and it worked. Now comes the long process of figuring out where it went wrong, I will reply when i find out maybe it can help anybody else who comes across this. Thanks for the help but those models were added ages ago and work fine, don&#39;t really know why they throw any errors at all lol</p>

<p>Reply By: Wild<br />I just figured it could be the problem because they were the only errors it showed haha. Well I&#39;m glad you figured it out!</p>

<p>Reply By: PyroFlames<br />Yea that has been removed just happend to be in the backup that I had compiled trying to fix things, still haven&#39;t found the script that caused it but have a few more to sort through, Thanks again for the help guys!</p>

<p>Reply By: PyroFlames<br />So it appears that is was a combination of issues, first off something went wrong with a weapon install and once the weapons were removed another issue appeared because of a wall buy which derived from that weapon install, removed that and another issue was that one of my scripts was using some script files that were modified by the scripts i had installed therefor causing my script to hang trying access something that didn&#39;t exist, still confused why this didn&#39;t throw an error in the compiler and/or game but whatever. Fixed the script issue and I&#39;m good now, thanks for the help guys. Gonna be a bit more careful when installing something and it tries to overwrite lol</p>
