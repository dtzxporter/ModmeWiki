<p>Thread By: Yasser143<br />Is there a way for me to make my prefab model, disappear when the player holds F on it, and make it appear somewhere else in my map?</p>

<p>Reply By: natesmithzombies<br />Prefabs aren&#39;t scriptable by themselves. You need to make everything in the prefab a script_model or a script_brushmodel. Depending on how many things you have in your prefab this could be a bad idea as there is a limit to the amount of entities, aka script_models/brushmodels, you can have in the game at one time. If it is &lt;5 I wouldn&#39;t think it is an issue. There are multiple ways to go about doing it though if you decide to take that route</p>

Read through the code for the proper targetnames and thread this in your mapname.gsc<br /><br />[CODE=php]function hide_and_show()<br />{<br />	level endon( &quot;intermission&quot; ); <br /><br />	models = GetEntArray( &quot;hide_show_model&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	trig = GetEnt( &quot;hide_show_trig&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	trig SetCursorHint( &quot;HINT_NOICON&quot; );<br />	trig SetHintString( &quot;Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Hide Models&quot; ); <br /><br />	foreach( model in models )<br />		model.is_visible = true; <br /><br />	while(1)<br />	{		<br />		trig waittill( &quot;trigger&quot;, player ); <br />		foreach( model in models )<br />		{<br />			if( model.is_visible )<br />			{<br />				model hide(); <br />				model.is_visible = false; <br />				wait(2); <br />				trig SetHintString( &quot;Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Show Models&quot; ); <br />			}<br />			<br />			else if( !model.is_visible )<br />			{<br />				model show(); <br />				model.is_visible = true; <br />				wait(2); <br />				trig SetHintString( &quot;Press and Hold ^3&amp;&amp;1^7 to Hide Models&quot; ); <br />			}<br />		}<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />[/CODE]</p>

Not one that makes the script_model disappear and reappear in the same location. Also wanted one that removes the trigger when used once time, so basically you cant use the trigger anymore after one use. I understand if u are to busy to help me.</p>

I can make and release an entire script as other users might find it useful to have something like this too. So I have some questions before I make it: <br /><br />1) Do you want the meteor loop sound to play on the trigger while it is waiting to be used? <br /><br />2) Do you want the order to randomize? <br /><br />3) What reward do you want after triggering it? <br /><br />4) How do you want it to be triggered? Use? Touch? Shoot?<br /><br />It wont take me long. I just can&#39;t do it without being at my home computer and me being home is all too rare anymore lol</p>

Use (a hidden trigger so players don&#39;t see the icon to pick it up).<br /><br />Sorry if Im asking for too much.</p>
