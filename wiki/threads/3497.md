<p>Is there a way to modify the position of the viewarms/weapon so the Raygun appears as it normally should?<br /><br />I decided to create a buffed Raygun, as the standard one is too weak.<br />The image below shows this instance of the Raygun, as shown by the green battery as opposed to the generic blue (Both are considered different weapons).<br /><br />I have ripped all the assets from BO3, including models, images and anims.<br /><br />The animations work, but are virtually out of view. (For reference, this is the idle anim)<br />It affects both the custom and base Raygun too, so I can attribute it to problems with the animations.<br /><br />I have no idea what is causing this to happen.<br /><br />I have done the following:<br /><ul><li>The Raygun is a view model with type animated.<br /><li>The viewarms are from Bo3 (Firebreak&#39;s).<br /><li>The joints have been bound properly and the animations work as intended in 3rd person preview mode with both Maya and APE.<br /><li>The anims utilise the entirety of the joint hierarchy. I have tried exporting all joints from tag_torso and below too with no luck.<br /><li>The animation settings in APE do not use bones, and are set to relative. <br /></li></li></li></li></li></ul>So what causes this to happen?<img style="max-width: 500px;" src="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.911.jpg' | relative_url }}"></p>

<p>for most anims you select [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]tag_torso[/COLOR], [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]tag_cambone [/COLOR]and THEIR [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]hierarchy[/COLOR]<br />for ads anims just [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]tag_torso [/COLOR]and [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]tag_view[/COLOR]</p>
