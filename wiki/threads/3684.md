<p>So I&#39;ve been playing around with scripting my own gun game. However I noticed when the &quot;points to next weapon&quot; updates, using settext, my frames drop.<br />The frames drop worse when the weapon and points update together.<br />I assumed it was just because my pc is trash and I was testing it in my near finished map. So I threw it in a test map and still got noticeable frame drops.<br /><br />This is what I used to update, I&#39;d just have this run when my current score was not the same as my old score, then update the old score to the new one:<br />{% highlight php %}
goalhud SetText( &quot;Points To Advance: &quot; +goal );{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />I also tried to make what I wanted the text to say defined as a variable like so:<br />{% highlight php %}
goal_text = &quot;Points To Advance: &quot; +goal;
goalhud SetText( goal_text );  {% endhighlight %}
  <br /><br />As expected, it changed nothing.<br /><br />Is there a way to update text on the hud without causing frame drops in gsc? Am I doing something incorrect?<br />I would assume I am haha.<br />I&#39;m guessing if I learned LUA, and set it up similar to the player score, I wouldn&#39;t have the issue.<br />I know it won&#39;t be as easy as I just said, but would LUA be my best option?<br /><br />I&#39;d appreciate any help, thanks for your time!</p>
