<p>The map is corrupt, try opening it as a prefab instead. Short of that go into \Call of Duty Black Ops III\radiant\autosave_backup and pick an older autosave</p>

When i load the map into bo3 its a newer version (i havent compiled it with the backup yet). Is there any way i could &quot;reverse compile&quot; that version of the map? Thanks again.</p>

If you&#39;re lucky, it&#39;ll work. As for reverse compiling a compiled bo3 map ? Nope. you&#39;re out of luck there. Scob intentionally did not support ripping of custom maps in bo3.</p>

<p><blockquote>What exactly do you mean? &quot;Copy the contents into an old map type?&quot; How do you do that? Thanks!<br /></blockquote><br />You open any &quot;old&quot; version of the .map file you are using, delete all the content below the header information and copy your new content underneath the old header. If you have no idea what i&#39;m talking about, i doubt i&#39;ll be able to help you.</p>
