If there is no path from the zombie to you, they will die and respawn in a zone that can get to you. </p></p>

You could write a script that kills all the zombies immediately which would cause them to respawn instantly in that zone. I currently have a gdtdb error which I am trying to resolve, so I am unable to write this myself at the moment.</p></p>

<p>Reply By: CT8918<br /><p style="text-align:left;">Here is a script that should kill all zombies. I can&#39;t test it at the moment but you could set up a multiple trigger that once touched, would run this code. The one thing is, what if the game wasn&#39;t a solo game and one player goes to the area? Would have to have something implemented to make sure all players were in the area. This below would work well, as is, if you plan on all players being in the same area at all times. </p><p style="text-align:left;"></p><p style="text-align:left;">Make sure to include:</p>{% highlight php %}
#using scripts\shared\ai\zombie_utility;
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align:left;"></p>{% highlight php %}
// kill all active zombies
zombies = zombie_utility::get_round_enemy_array();
if ( isdefined( zombies ) )
{
array::run_all( zombies, &amp;Kill );
}
{% endhighlight %}
