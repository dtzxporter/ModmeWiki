<p>Thread By: DJ_Dandy<br />I have been able to add custom weapons to my map, however I&#39;m having an issue with them not being able to be pack a punched.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/QYLdBOW.jpg"><br />I have my zm_test_weapons.csv located under usermaps/zm_test/gamedata/weapons/zm<br />With the weapons data added to it.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/tXUUG4j.png"><br />I have the weapons added to my zone file, and i put the test for the user_aliases in. <br />Here is my zone file.<br /><img style="max-width: 500px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/cpYNWhp.png"><br />Another note this isn&#39;t an issue specific to the gun in the image. I&#39;ve added two other weapons for multiple people&#39;s ports and both have run into the issue.</p>

Its all in the levelcommon.csv file</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />Try following this tutorial:<br /> <br /><a href="http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/black_ops_3/basics/setup_mystery_box_weapons/">http://phabricator.aviacreations.com/w/black_ops_3/basics/setup_mystery_box_weapons/</a><br /> <br />While the tutorial says Mystery Box, this is also responsible for Pack a Punch (since it goes over adding the weapons to csv and loading the csv).</p>

I think it might be due to my placement of the files. <br />- zm_test_weapons.csv<br />I originally had this under: Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\zm_test\gamedata\weapons\zm. The tutorial makes it seem like it should be under: Call of Duty Black Ops III\share\raw\gamedata\weapons\zm<br />So I have a copy of it in both locations, which place should it be in?<br />- zm_usermap.gsc<br />- zm_usermap.csc<br />Both are under: BlackOps3Root/share/raw/scripts/zm, I changed the line looking at the weapons I don&#39;t think the problem is in here.<br />- zm_test.csc<br />- zm_test.gsc<br />Again I am a bit confused as to where these should be. The tutorial didn&#39;t say change directories, so should it be under: BlackOps3Root/share/raw/scripts/zm?<br />I had it under: Call of Duty Black Ops III\usermaps\zm_test\scripts\zm and in BlackOps3Root/share/raw/scripts/zm, again which is the proper place?<br />- test.zone<br />Added the lines from tutorial, again I don&#39;t think this is the problem either. I am also wondering with stringtable and scriptparsetree they are only looking in the zm_test folder right not in the share?<br />- Thank you for the replies</p>

<p>Reply By: mathfag<br />The usermaps and zm_tests should be in mapname/scripts/zm/<br />I&#39;d leave the levelcomon_weapons file in the root/share... location cuz if i leave it in the mapname folder it doesnt work half the time.<br /> <br />You need to add this to the zone for the new weapon file to function<br />[CODE=php]//Custom box weapons<br />stringtable,gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons_935.csv // Whatever name you gave your csv and referenced in the 4 scripts<br />//Custom usermap modifications<br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.gsc // Only if you do not already have this in this file elsewhere<br />scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.csc // Only if you do not already have this in this file elsewhere<br />[/CODE]</p>

You need to add this to the zone for the new weapon file to function //Custom box weapons stringtable,gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_levelcommon_weapons_935.csv // Whatever name you gave your csv and referenced in the 4 scripts //Custom usermap modifications scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.gsc // Only if you do not already have this in this file elsewhere scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.csc // Only if you do not already have this in this file elsewhere      </blockquote><br /> Yep that was it. I guess I thought by usermaps they meant my map name. Everything is functioning now thank you very much for you time.</p>
