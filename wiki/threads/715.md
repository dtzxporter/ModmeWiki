<p>Thread By: djluvorng<br />Hi I need help finding a way to script in the above description. I am new to scripting but I think I can use the &quot;HasWeapon&quot; function like so<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
if( level.player HasWeapon( "zapper" )); ...{% endhighlight %}
<br />I just need a function to tell whether you miss or not. Any help would be appreciated ;)</p>
