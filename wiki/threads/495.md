<p>Thread By: Vekah<br />I&#39;ve played many maps where you can choose which doors to open first, so you could 2 ways around a map. All of the videos i have watched on zones only explain how to go from zone1 to zone2 and so on, not both ways.<br />So if there are three rooms connecting eachother, zone1, zone2 and zone3. <br />I will have the zone2 into zone3 setup for one door, but then if i go around the other way, how do i make it so you can from zone3 into zone2?<br />Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Reply By: yologirlgamer<br />I had the same problem but it’s actually really simple! So for example.. say you have 3 lanes... put the middle one (zone1,zone2,zone3) and so on... and for example for the left side put (zone1,zone1_side,enter_zone1_side) and so on...(zone1_side2) same for the right but put something different like (right side)..then make the spawners (zone1_side_spawners) so whatever zone the path is leading from make sure you put that zone first so another example (zone3,zone3_side,enter_zone3_side) that’s how I’ve always done my zones anyway! I’d post my script but I’m currently at work hope this helps !! :)</p>

<p>Reply By: Abnormal202<br />your basic zone code is like this:<br />{% highlight php %}
zm_zonemgr::add_adjacent_zone( "start_zone",		"zone1",	"zone_start-1" );{% endhighlight %}
 <br />the first two arguments being targetnames of zones, and the third being a flag. Basically whenever this flag is called it activates &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; zones. So it doesn&#39;t matter what zone goes first. Just have a line of code like this for everytime two zones are adjacent to one another and type the flag in as the &quot;script_flag&quot; on the door between them. It won&#39;t matter which direction players open the door from.</p>
