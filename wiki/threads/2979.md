<p>Hi all,<br />I recently spent some time working on a lua file that would allow a user to inject custom hud code into the main level hud. With this method, you would be able to add hud content to stock maps without ripping and rebuilding the stock files. This would be most useful in mods, but it&#39;s also compatible with maps.<br /><br />Installation is simple.<br />1. Copy all the files and folders to your map or mod&#39;s folder<br />2. Add {% highlight php %}
LuiLoad(&quot;ui.HUDInject.HUDInject&quot;);{% endhighlight %}
to your CSC file<br />3. Add {% highlight php %}
rawfile,ui/HUDInject/HUDInject.lua{% endhighlight %}
to your zone<br />Done!<br /><br />The injector file has adequate documentation and is extensible. Ping me on discord if you have any questions.</p>

<p>EDIT: References to a powerup widget I&#39;ve been working on have been left in the Injector lua. Remove these to avoid errors.</p>
