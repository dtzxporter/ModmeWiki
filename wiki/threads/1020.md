<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br />this is really easy to do, add this line to your maps GSC in function main.<br /> <br />[CODE=php]level.zombie_powerup_weapon[ &quot;minigun&quot; ] = GetWeapon( &quot;minigun&quot; );[/CODE]<br />[CODE=php]change = GetWeapon( &quot;minigun&quot; ); to whatever you want as the weapon. level.zombie_powerup_weapon[ &quot;minigun&quot; ] = GetWeapon( &quot;set weapon here&quot; );[/CODE]</p>

<p>Reply By: tbone-5<br /><blockquote><em>itznvy</em><br />Any way to make it where the chosen weapon has unlimited Ammo?</blockquote><br /> it depends do you have a custom weapon or are you using a stock weapon? if its a custom weapon copy the weapon file the name you put in your zone like weapon,weaponname_zm when you make a new weapon file just click the option unlimited ammo done, then add the new weapon file name to that death machine script &amp; make sure you add it to the zone. now for non custom weapons ask a scripter i mostly just edit scripts i am not good at making them myself, i found the death machine change script in the script for the death machine in like December &amp; had it laying around in my gsc</p>
