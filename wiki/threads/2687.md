<p><span style="color:#00ffff;">ABNORMAL202 SCRIPTING TUTORIAL 6: PROPERTIES</span><br /> <br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/abnormal202-scripting-tutorials-master.2680/">See ALL Tutorials</a><br /> <br /><span style="color:#00ffff;">DESCRIPTION</span><br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffcc00;">Properties</span> are very similar to <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variables</span>, and I probably would&#39;ve talked about them in the <a href="http://aviacreations.com/modme/index.php?view=topic&tid=2640">variables tutorial</a>, however I thought that one was long enough and didn&#39;t want to overwhelm.<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffcc00;">Properties</span> are just more ways we can store information into a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span>, and you&#39;ll see them quite a lot.<br /> <br /> <br /><span style="color:#00ffff;">CREATING A PROPERTY</span><br /> <br />You can create a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span> on a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> simply by putting a &quot;<span style="color:#ffcc00;">.</span>&quot; at the end of it and then adding the name to your <span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span>, and finally defining it.<br /> <br />[CODE=php]andrew = GetEnt(&quot;andrew&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br /><br />andrew.gender = &quot;male&quot;;[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />In the above example, I made a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> andrew (with some ent in radiant stored in it), and then gave it the <span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span> of &quot;gender&quot;, which I defined as &quot;male&quot;.<br /> <br />Just like with <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variables</span>, <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> can store numbers, strings, booleans, and even entities.<br /> <br />[CODE=php]andrew.clip = GetEnt(&quot;andrew_clip&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />We can do all the same things we can do with <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variables</span> with <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span>. For example using in <span style="color:#ffcc00;">functions</span>:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]andrew.clip Delete();[/CODE]<br /> <br />It&#39;s important to note if this code was executed, the entity in radiant with targetname: &quot;andrew_clip&quot; would be deleted, not the entity with targetname: &quot;andrew&quot;, because the <span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span> is being sent to the Delete() function, not the actual andrew <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span>.<br /> <br /><span style="color:#ffcc00;">Properties</span> are also often used to check for certain conditions in <span style="color:#ffcc00;">If Statements</span>:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]if(isdefined(andrew.gender) &amp;&amp; andrew.gender == &quot;male&quot;)<br />{<br />    IPrintLnBold(&quot;By golly, you&#39;re a man!&quot;);<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br />Really the sky is limit. You can even make <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> <strong>of</strong> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span>:<br /> <br />[CODE=php]andrew = GetEnt(&quot;andrew&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />andrew.clothing = &quot;on&quot;;<br />andrew.clothing.top = &quot;t_shirt&quot;;<br />andrew.clothing.top.color = &quot;red&quot;;[/CODE]<br /> <br /> <br />It should be noted that passing a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> that has <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> on it <strong>will retain all <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> on it</strong> in the <span style="color:#ffcc00;">function</span> it is being passed to.<br /> <br />for example:<br />[CODE=php]    andrew = GetEnt(&quot;andrew&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />    andrew.clothing = &quot;on&quot;;<br />    andrew.clothing.top = &quot;t_shirt&quot;;<br />    andrew.clothing.top.color = &quot;red&quot;;<br />    andrew thread clothing_appraisal();<br />}<br />function clothing_appraisal()<br />{<br />    if(isdefined(self.clothing) &amp;&amp; self.clothing == &quot;on&quot;)<br />    {<br />        if(isdefined(self.clothing.top) &amp;&amp; self.clothing.top == &quot;t_shirt&quot;)<br />        {<br />            if(isdefined(self.clothing.top.color) &amp;&amp; self.clothing.top.color == &quot;red&quot;)<br />            {<br />                IPrintLnBold(&quot;I think red looks rather nice on you&quot;);<br />            }<br />        }<br />    }<br />}[/CODE]<br /> <br /><span style="color:#00ffff;">LEVEL PROPERTIES</span><br /> <br />Remember that <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> I talked about earlier, that can be accessed from anywhere and is the same entity according to <strong>all</strong> scripts? that <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> is called <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span>, and there&#39;s a reason Sublime highlights it in purple.<br /> <br />Because it&#39;s the same everywhere, setting <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> on the <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">variable</span> makes it easy to access said<span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> wherever, from any script/function/you name it. Using <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> is the quick &amp; easy solution to passing data, without having to call, thread, or pass arguments.<br /> <br />However there&#39;s a reason I&#39;ve introduced this a bit late, in tutorial #6, because I see a lot of novice scripters overuse to death the <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span>, myself included. Because of how easy it was to use, I used it for a bunch of things that using self, or arguments would have done fine for, and that led to me not knowing how to pass data in other ways than <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span><span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span>.<br /> <br />Other than that, Why shouldn&#39;t you use <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span>?<br />- You don&#39;t want to accidentally create a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span> that has the same name as one already defined in Treyarch scripts, as you could really break stuff by overriding a Treyarch<span style="color:#ffcc00;">property</span>, or having yours overridden. (though this is also a problem with setting <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> on players, or any common entity that&#39;s going to be in the game regardless of the map)<br />- Setting tons of <span style="color:#ff00ff;">level</span> <span style="color:#ffcc00;">properties</span> (for things that don&#39;t need it) can make your scripts a lot harder to follow, for other people or yourself later. <br /> <br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/abnormal202-scripting-tutorials-master.2680/">See ALL Tutorials</a></p>
