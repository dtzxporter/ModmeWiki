<p>Thread By: zomboassasin<br />Hey guys<br /><br />Can someone please make a simple teleport script for me?<br /><br />What i need is when the player falls/passes through a trigger it starts a timer<br /><br />and when that timer ends i need it to teleport all the players in a specific area back to the spawn or a certain point. <br /><br />Thanks!</p>

I am assuming you want the player to fall through an area, and then have a set amount of time to do something before being teleported to zone that has already been activated. If that is the case: <br /><br />Insert a trigger&gt;multiple into your map with the KVPs: targetname - timer_trig. Also insert a script&gt;origin with the KVPs: targetname - timer_origin. The insert this code in your mapname.gsc at the bottom:<br /><br />[CODE=php]function trigger_timer()<br />{<br />	trigger = GetEnt( &quot;timer_trig&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	<br />	while(1)<br />	{<br />		trigger waittill( &quot;trigger&quot;, player );<br />		player thread timed_run(); <br />	}<br />}<br /><br />function timed_run()<br />{<br />	org = GetEnt( &quot;timer_origin&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot; ); <br />	wait(30); // Change this to whatever you want <br />	self SetOrigin( org.origin ); <br />}[/CODE]<br /><br /><br /><br />Thread your function in mapname.gsc so it looks something like this: <br /><br />[CODE=php]function main()<br />{<br />    level thread trigger_timer(); [/CODE]</p>

When you finally teleport after the amount of time you set all the other times the script was started are still trying to catch up. So basically it will teleport you there for however long you were in the trigger after the set amount of time. <br /><br />In the example I am using this for the player falls through the trigger so he only hit it for a like half a second. So when i get teleported it works fine because it only teleports me there once. To fix it you would have to change the code so it only gets activated once or change the map so the player only is able to touch it for a brief amount of time. <br /><br />Hope this helps</p>
