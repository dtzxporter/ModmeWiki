<p>After installing and compiling my map, when Brutus did spawn everything seems to work like it should, but the second I start shooting him the game crashes to desktop. No error logs, no nothing the game just closes to desktop. Any idea why that would happen?</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t spawn in my game on the round (8) I set him to spawn on. The struct needs no KVPs just the target name as cellbreaker_spot? How does it work with zones if I have a spawnpoint in a zone the player maybe hasn&#39;t activated yet</p>

How does it work with zones if I have a spawnpoint in a zone the player maybe hasn&#39;t activated yet<br /></blockquote><br />did you set AUTOSPAWN to 1 in the script?<br />the struct only has a targetname. the script picks the closest spawn point and if it&#39;s not in an active zone it picks the next closest etc.</p>

<p><blockquote>First of all, awesome work! This Brutus is definitely alot crazier.<br /><br />However, I&#39;m getting GDT errors with this even though I have NSZ Brutus fully removed (I think). Brutus works fine and map works fine if I compile with ignore errors ticked, but i dont like to do that. How do I fix this?[ATTACH=full]412[/ATTACH]<br /></blockquote><br />Go into APE and remove the dupes either from my gdt or the default.<br />The additional assets dlc adds some materials but because some people don&#39;t have it I included them.<br />This brutus should be able to run side by side with NSZ&#39;s</p>

<p>It doesnt work for me. No errors or anything, theres just no sign of anything working. Autospawn is off, first round spawn is set to 2 but nothing happens at round 2. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Do you have the Targetname cellbreaker_spawner<br /> on the actor? I had the same problem and that&#39;s what it was I just missed a simple thing.</p>

<p>Hey, I got him to spawn in and everything works great, I love it. Nice work!<br />However, some things are a little weird. It seems that his “spawn in” sound is quiet, and so are his voice lines. Is there any way to increase the audio of these (maybe like in audacity?). Also, there’s a weird issue. After he activated his smoke bomb, not only does nothing appear, but he just stops moving after doing so. The animation of him will play, but it doesn’t activate and he just stops in place completely . He does however attack when I get very close to him in this “stuck” position. Let me know if there are solutions to these issues.<br /><br />But besides that, he is great. Definitely a buffed Brutus!!! I love it!<br /><br />Regards,<br />the_bibba_boy</p>

<p><blockquote>Can you change the brutus model to another model?

Note it should have the same bones or atleast the spine, legs, arms and head bones.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t want to destroy the og brutus installation, make a copy of the archetype, copy of the character entry (thing above) and change the model in there. Then assign the character to the new archetype. If you don&#39;t understand this, just stick with the stuff above</p>

But the Harry&#39;s Lua script make so the tool launcher stop working, so can&#39;t have the new bo4 perks, madgaz perks etc... Same with Goliath, no working, so tested this Brutus to see if one boss work, but no :/<br /><br />But my new map is hard anyway xD I&#39;m best to making maps hard without any scripts, ask SmokieMcPotter and my last map that was the hardest map alive Admited by Icegrenade too xD</p>

<p>To anyone and everyone having trouble with Brutus standing still and not chasing you, try this:<br /><br />Find this line (line 230):<br />entity.go_break_barrier = 1;<br /><br />Change to:<br />entity.go_break_barrier = 0;<br /><br />Me and LilMatteus figured this out as he couldn&#39;t get it working. The other option is to setup your window placement better because brutus is close enough to it to target it but cant figure out how to get to it for whatever reason. I would bet the barrier just needs moved forwards towards the playable area.</p>

I will look into changing the smoke fx. Thank you by the way! Excellent work on the brutus it is quite good even without the tear gas.</p>

<p>Update 1.0.3<br />-Almost certainly fixed brutus stopping 10 secs into his rampage (will prob ignore some windows)<br />-Edited the spawn point function to not freeze the game (connection interrupted) under certain conditions when spawning him</p>

<p><blockquote>No, you are missing a material. Either install harrys fx pack or change the smoke image in the fx editor.<br />As for the window thing, I&#39;ll push an update tomorrow<br /></blockquote><br />So I tried duplicating an fx and saving it with the name the file wanted. take the teargas smoke for example. I saved a smoke effect as the name it calls for in the custom/AI fx folder and the error still remains. How do I go about fixing it? Sorry to be a bother, but I would like to try and have it totally working. Also IDK how I would be missing any materials especially between having additional assets installed and harry&#39;s fx pack</p>

<p><blockquote>Yeah it must be something else thats causing it not to work because I just don&#39;t understand why it wouldn&#39;t since your doing everything correct. Yeah dude you made Bullen&#39;s Tower right? that map was insane haha I loved it :D<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />I did it!!! Got help from MyNameIsNobody and it was the struct that needed to be over the floor and not like all the zombie spawns :P<br />Also made harrys perks and bo4 perks works as well, something error I said, but everything is fixed and I hope my new Crazy map will be an Succee!!!</p>

<p>Aight imma update this soon. It will include a better spawn point system for all you having trouble spawning him (no spawn point found), some new traversal animations, and a new targetservice.<br />Is there anything you guys want to see added?

<p>Awesome!!!<br />Hopefully people gonna use these custom settings, and not just drag and drop.<br /><br />Funy idea imo i wish to suggest:<br /><br />what about an option making the helmet a soulbox you need to feed with zombies arounds? It then becomes the only way to kill it. every zombies you kill in a radius crreate a beam from their body to the helmet. :ROFLMAO:</p>

The problem is that the bottom of your zone most likely ends at the same level as the center of the struct therefore its technically not in the zone and not accepted by the spawn system. I will fix this in the next update. Until then you can just extend your zones in the negative z axis (down)<br /><br />Enjoy the rest of your evening</p>

<p>I made this Brutus as a Boss in the end of my Tower map, he spawns with a lot of health, but one knife hit when hes frozen by the Bull Ice Blast perk from Madgaz. I love that perk on my map, because the double jump with many holes. And the helping Freeze effect on the zombies to get points by knifing fast before the water closing you. So its a Have-To-Perk xD But against the boss, one hit kill :/ So maybe would be awesome if the perks had no effect against him. Like, the Banana colada slide etc.</p>
