<p>Reply By: Kyroflash<br />Am I supposed to add something to the mod.csv to get this to work? I can&#39;t find it in the instructions anywhere,<br /><br />specifically exactly what to add? like weapon,sp/bo2_zm_shield_origins  ?<br /><br />Also I&#39;m having the exact same error as the post above.<br /><br />The way I installed this was by overwriting the default files with your 3 latest version scripts.<br /><br />Then overwrote the ff and the localized and dropped the Iwd in the mod directory.</p>

You&#39;ll need to go into the post for each asset that .ff contains, download it, and follow the instructions, only when it tells you to copy over a .ff, you use this instead.</p>

<p>Reply By: Harry Bo21<br />Exo is right, this is why I linked the posts here<br /><br /><br /><br />As for the missing images - I&#39;ll sort that later today<br /><br /><br /><br />Then add my dig sites too</p>

I guess I am just waiting on the update for the missing iwd images.<br /><br />But also I have read all the instructions in the shield install, it gets to a part where it says add whatever shield you want<br /><br />using the included mod.csv, which there is none. And there is no reference that I can find as to what to add to the csv<br /><br />to enable the origins shield, that was the only part of the instructions that was not clear. I would appreciate is anyone knows where I can find this information<br /><br />let me know.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks</p>

Open it with 7zip and merge the folders. The images you are missing are from the craftables 4.0 iwd in the image folder. Lol adding it to the raw folder won&#39;t do any good unless you were to include each on in your mod.csv, my bad.</p>

<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Ok The first thing I noticed is that you are using both a localized and a patch ff. Do you have some other mod installed or is that patch and localized file both from harry&#39;s combined ffs? You should only use the localized OR the patch not both.<br /><br />let me know if that helps</p>

<p>Reply By: ElectricBullet<br />Thank you very much, Harry. So, if I download the fourth one, with the shields and perks, I just follow the instructions in each of the separate downloads but use the ff and iwd I downloaded here where it tells me? Is there anything else I need to change? The sound and FX errors, of course, but anything else?</p>

<p>Reply By: djluvorng<br />I am getting a bunch of weird errors regarding your perks. Mostly script compile errors on things which should not be script compile errors.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here are a few:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
unknown function
player thread maps\_zombiemode_origins_hud::setup_player();

unknown function
maps\_zombiemode_custom_triggers::init();

unknown function
if ( !self is busy() &amp;&amp; !selfisMeleeing() &amp;&amp; isDefined( self.current_shield_ammo ) &amp;&amp; self.current_shield_ammo &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; isDefined( level.shields[ weapname ].fire_function ) ){% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I got past the first 2 errors by commenting them out, but have not gotten past the 3rd one<br /><br /><br /><br />Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention I am using the Combined ff file. Obvously because of the reference to the shield. lol<br /><br /><br /><br />Update: I got past the errors by spamming the play map button. Eventually it loads the map up to the last bit. Unfortunately, it stops loading there and freezes. I think I might just have too much stuff in my map. idk.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>//Mod edit: Please remember to embed your code!</em></p>
