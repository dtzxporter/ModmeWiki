<p>Thread By: hubigygjjik<br />Hey whatsapp, i&#39;ve been creating a map with the name zm_Prototype a long time ago. When Treyarch realased the chronicles update I noticed that I couldn&#39;t open my map because the name zm_prototype was already in use for natch der untoten. When i realised that I started changeing every file from zm_Prototype to zm_DerMaisten. When I finished doing that I noticed that my map was a little rare. Its like there are no models or something like that.<br /> <br />Here are the pics:<br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/acb3808089bd39693d296c60922efbf5">https://gyazo.com/acb3808089bd39693d296c60922efbf5</a><br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/1bf64a6f045a2a791b0b69e10ef693b6">https://gyazo.com/1bf64a6f045a2a791b0b69e10ef693b6</a><br /> <br />When I link my map the only &#168;error&#168; is this one.

If it is not solved, erase and reinstall mod tools but make sure to backup your .map doing it prefab :)</p>
