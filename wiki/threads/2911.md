<p>Hello! I have been looking all over to figure out how to give all players all perks after they complete the task of finding the items I want them to find. I have 13 perks in the map but only 6 can be bought. I want the rest to be rewarded for completing the EE. Anyone can help point me in the right direction?<br /><br />Thanks<br />-BC<br /><br />P.S<br /><br />If it wasn&#39;t obvious, this is for my custom zombies map for BO3</p>
