<p>I’m not making a zombie map, I’m making custom models and I want to know how to add custom lines into them when you’re making a mod and not a zombie map.<br /><br />I’ve looked everywhere and there hasn’t been any reaching out to help. All the tutorials I’ve looked at are when you’re adding them to a zombie map, that’s not what I’m doing. I’m just making a mod.</p>

<p>I made a custom mod for myself that replaces the characters of all maps with the SOE characters (including their voice lines) and also does some other stuff.<br />It&#39;s acutally exactly the same way you would put it into the map.<br /><br />add your alias file to your zm_mod.zone<br />add your alias file to your zm_mod.szc<br />add [ICODE]thread add_zm_vox();[/ICODE] to your zm_mod.gsc main function<br />and add this function into your gsc file<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
function add_zm_vox()
{
    zm_audio::loadPlayerVoiceCategories(&quot;gamedata/audio/zm/zm_vox.csv&quot;);
}{% endhighlight %}
<br />I&#39;m not sure if that helps but if you don&#39;t have it already i would recommend you to use TrueGamerCalls Mod Template. it makes things a lot easier<br /><a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/tgc-mod-template-easy-to-make-mods-for-zm-mp.2390/">https://forum.modme.co/threads/tgc-mod-template-easy-to-make-mods-for-zm-mp.2390/</a></p>

The only lines that play are the ones for when the player gets hurt. Any Idea how to fix that?</p>

Any Idea how to fix that?<br /></blockquote><br /><br />- make sure that you use a valid player voice categories file inside your add zm vox function<br />- do you get an error during compiling from the sound compiler? Something like &quot;object reference not set to an instance of an object&quot;. If yes , comment out the sound file/s that throws errors from your alias and see if that works<br />- rebulld your sound files - remove sabs and sabl files from your mod directory. (You maybe have to link 2 times)</p>

<p>see, you can actually follow any tutorial that shows how to put voxes into a map and everytime the tutorial says to put something into &quot;usermaps/zm_yourmap&quot; you put it into &quot;mods/mod_yourmod&quot; instead. <br />instead of &quot;zm_yourmap.szc&quot; call the files for example &quot;mod_yourmod.szc&quot;<br /><br />you can find many tutorials about this on this forum, youtube or here:<br /><a href="https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Voxes">https://wiki.zeroy.com/index.php?title=Call_of_Duty_bo3:_ZM_Voxes</a><br /><br />once you&#39;ve set everything up you can just replace the files inside your vox aliases file (share/raw/sound/aliases/zm_vox.csv)<br /><br />hope this helps</p>
