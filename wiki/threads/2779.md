<p>I&#39;m trying to access custom kvps of a trigger from a script similar to <a href="https://forum.modme.co/threads/abnormal202-scripting-tutorial-5-script-radiant-relation.2686/">this tutorial</a>. But it appears that they&#39;re not being recognised as valid by the script.<br />{% highlight php %}
function test1()
 {
     trig = GetEnt(&quot;trig1&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);
    
        
         while(1)
         {
             IPrintLnBold(trig.test);
             wait(5);
         }

}{% endhighlight %}
<br /><a href="{{ '/wiki/threads/assets/a.190.PNG' | relative_url }}">Download "triggerkvps.PNG"</a><br /><br />&quot;abc&quot; should be printed right?</p>
