<p>Hi, so I&#39;m trying to show and hide a door. Basically when you touch the trigger_multiple, a door will show, and after 2 min the door dissapear. The problem is, the script doesn&#39;t do anything :(<br />I&#39;m using script_multiple, script_model and script_brushmodel so I think that&#39;s not the problem. Here&#39;s my script:<br />[CODE=php]//Boss fight<br />level thread boss_fight();<br /><br /><br /><br />//Boss Fight<br />function boss_fight()<br />{<br />    trig = GetEnt(&quot;boss_fight_trig&quot;,&quot;targetname&quot;);<br />    bfdoor = GetEnt(&quot;bf_door&quot;, &quot;targetname&quot;);<br /><br />    //Hide door<br />    bfdoor Hide();<br /><br />    trig waittill(&quot;trigger&quot;,player);<br /><br />    //Boss fight<br />    bfdoor Show(); //Show door<br />    level flag::set( &quot;spawn_zombies&quot; ); //Start zombie spawn<br />    player playsound(&quot;music_BW&quot;); //Start music<br />    wait(120); //Fight time<br />    bfdoor Delete(); //Delete door<br />}[/CODE]<br /><br />Any help would be really really appreciated :(</p>

<p>So what exactly is the problem? Does the door never show up? Never delete? or what?</p>

I&#39;m trying to make them dissappear after the 2 minutes</p>

I&#39;m assuming either you&#39;re not waiting the full two minutes or there&#39;s a typo in one of the targetnames</p>
