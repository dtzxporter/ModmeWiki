<p>Reply By: Azsry<br />Yay  All my favourite Maya export plugins merged into one! Great work all of you.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: It seems Ray&#39;s toolkit still has this issue with Maya 2016 where it breaks because the time values it grabs are floats, but it expects integers. It&#39;s fixed quite easily by casting animStart and animEnd to integers, however:<br /><br /><br /><br />Line 2295:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
for i in range(animStart,animEnd+1):{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />to:<br /><br />{% highlight php %}
for i in range(int(animStart),int(animEnd+1)):{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br /><br />I have yet to see any side effects from this cast, but there may be if your animations start on non-integer frames.</p>

<p>Reply By: xSanchez78<br /><blockquote><em>CrossFire</em>guys im a noob how do i make a new usersetup.mel file ??</blockquote><br /><br />Right click in the directory, click New-&gt;Text File, and rename the name part to usersetup and the .txt to .mel, and it should work. <br /><br />Also the grab notes thing doesn&#39;t work for me, it can&#39;t find notes for tanims atleast. And how do I export the notes from seanims?</p>

I had both python(&quot;import CoDMayaTools&quot;); and python(&quot;import SEAToolsPlugin&quot;); in my usersetup.mel, however I had a &#39; at the end of python(&quot;import SEAToolsPlugin&quot;); so it looked like this: python(&quot;import SEAToolsPlugin&quot;);&#39;     and that caused them not to show up in maya :/ ahhh I am such a noob xD But it&#39;s part of the learning process lol</p></p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />A new update has been released to this which includes some fixes and new features:<br /> <br /><ul><li>*Moved all settings to a sub menu and make them check boxes, before it required a refresh of the menu which crashed 2017 on occasions. (which seems to happen on any script I&#39;ve tried that deletes and recreates UI)<br /><br /><li>*Optimized the ReadNotes functions with a list and loop so they are now easier to read and modify., instead of a mess of if and elifs.<br /><br /><li>+Add a Button to grab frames from scene so you no longer need to manually enter start and end frame.<br /><br /></li></li></li></ul>Of course any issues do let Ray or I know.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />A test version has been released that some might wanna give a go, after Porter showed me PyCod for AutoGDT I decided to give a go at implementing it into CoDMayaTools.<br /> <br />Essentially this ads direct *_BIN support from the tool, no Export2Bin.exe junk. To use this update download the latest from pycod branch here:<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/Ray1235/CoDMayaTools/tree/pycod_implementation">Download</a> <br />And simply put the CoDMayaTools.py and pycod folder into your scripts folder. I have done several test with different models including weighted, multiple materials, over 65k, etc. and all seem to work. Of course none of that would be possible without work of those on PyCod (which of course make sure to checkout the dev. version of Blender-CoD which has support for _BINS also).<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/SE2Dev/PyCoD">https://github.com/SE2Dev/PyCoD</a><br /> <br />Please note this is a TEST version, and while tests worked, both PyCoD and this implementation are not finished, so it&#39;s not unlikely you might run into issues, please do report any you find.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br /><blockquote><em>Dcchill</em><br />For some reason some of the buttons, like the export xmodel button, dont work for me</blockquote><br /> <br />This could be many things, we need more information than this such as Maya Version, Other 3rd Party Plugins, Script Editor Output, etc.<br /> <br />I have used it on 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2018, all features work on them.</p>

<p>Reply By: Scobalula<br />A semi-major update has been released (Version 2.7.0):<br /> <br /><ul><li>Full implementation of PyCod including support for more xmodel versions (version is defined by game you select in Games Settings), direct to xanim/xmodel_bin with support for cosmetics* and other features that may come to PyCod as it is developed.<br /><br /></li></ul><ul><li>Added support for Call of Duty 1 and 2 Folders/Mode.<br /><br /></li></ul><ul><li>Removed the need for Grab Notes to select the notetracks to obtain the information which would deselect your current selection.<br /><br /></li></ul><ul><li>Fixed Notetracks on Reversed xAnims.<br /><br /></li></ul>* In order to export directly to bin, when setting your file path, select &quot;<em>Export Type</em> Binary File (.<em>Export Type</em>_bin)&quot; when exporting or change the path entry, if you have Black Ops 3 set as your current game, xbin will be automatically selected by default, and for the other games, _export will be the default when the file dialog is opened.<br /> <br />OP has been updated with new links/info.<br /> <br />Other features such as siege anim support, better xcam support, etc. to come.<br /> <br />Please report any issues.</p>
